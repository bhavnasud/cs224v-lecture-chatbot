So anything going on in your sinuses, you know, sinus infections, allergies can cause a chronic cough. Also, your GI systems cause a chronic cough, so heartburn, when you get acid from your stomach, can go up into your esophagus and cause, tickle your cough receptors in the back of your throat and cause a chronic cough. It's actually a very common cause of cough, especially in people who teach a lot, because you're projecting your voice and it causes you to compress your stomach and that pushes acid up in your stomach. And bringing too much Diet Coke. And getting too much Diet Coke. So those kind of the three things you think of. And then also the next thing is the nature of the cough. What is a cough like? So is it a dry cough? Is it a wet cough? Is there mucus coming up when you cough? Um, is it associated with pain when you take a deep breath or when you cough?

And just not to give his whole history, but he had COVID a couple years ago, twice in the fall, October 23 October 22, so it wasn't like a post COVID cough.

Yeah, how many, how many of your patients actually say, Hey, it all started when I had this cough? So very few of the patients that I take care of actually have any symptoms at all, as I'll get into.

These are the bronchi, so this is the left main bronchi and the right brain bronchi, and that's the trachea. And then these are the diaphragms. So when you look at the x-ray, you just want to look overall, um, what are the lung fields look like. You want to see if the heart is midline, um, is the heart silhouette normal size. You want to look at the corners here, the costophrenic corners, to see if there's any fluid. In this case, you know, this, if you look on the left side, this this is really sharp.

And so there's lymph nodes there that are enlarged and causing the, um, the heart to be a little bit wider than normal. And then if you look at the the bronchi, they're a little bit you know, your bronchi kinda more like this. They're a little bit more, you know, pushed out a little bit. So you wonder if there's lymph nodes there that kind of pressing the bronchi up a little bit. So it was not a normal X-ray. And, you know, we would probably just call this maybe right middle lobe pneumonia, perhaps, but it was very concerning with the shape of the mediastinum. And then on the lateral view, you can actually see some more details, and there's some details on the lateral view that suggested there was fluid around the bronchi on the right side. Um, and so we knew that the next step would be to do a CT scan to to see what's going on."

And then we got this CT scan, which was very concerning. Yeah. So on the scan, um, what you can see is just a big mass there and some increased lymph nodes.

So they sampled several levels of olefth nodes, um, and they used ultrasound guidance, uh, metastatic poorly differentiated non small cell carcinoma. So at that point I had a diagnosis, uh, but no staging at that. So next slide, please. And so the MRI was done first, MRI of the brain. And I had 50, numerous 50 enhancing lesions.

So a little bit of backstory I didn't mention earlier. One of the co founders of the Center For Asian Health, we founded this, I guess, really 6 years ago, but we started the process 7 years ago. And on our first kickoff day, uh, one of the talks was about how lung cancer and never smokers, uh, you know, it's really prevalent and highly prevalent among Asian women. Course, I'm an Asian man, uh, but also Asians generally have 50% have this mutation in their tumor as opposed to non Hispanic whites where it's less than 20% have this EGFR mutation. So, uh, ironically, I'd spent 6 years leading an organization, 7, well, almost 7 years, leading an organization, uh, where one of our priority areas among many other areas that impact agents differently is lung cancer and nonsmokers.

Um, I also run our lung cancer screening clinic and, um, one of the associate medical directors of the Stanford Cancer Center. So I'll talk a little bit of the background about lung cancer staging and screening. So lung cancer causes more deaths than any other cancer. If you look at the causes of death overall, cancer is about a 5th, and lung cancer is about a 5th of cancer deaths. So it's not the most common. The most common by far is breast cancer in women and prostate cancer in men, but lung cancer is a lot more deadly. So it is the most common cause of cancer death in both men and women. In the United States this year, they estimate about 125,000 people will die from lung cancer. And Doctor. Lin has mentioned staging."

So the stages always go from 1 through 4, um, 1 being the earliest and then 4 essentially being metastatic. Um, and here's my diagrams of lung cancer stages. So on the left for 1, it's when the tumor is quite small and it hasn't spread anywhere. Um, in stage 2, it's spread to lymph nodes that are really close by. So you can see this lymph node's right next to the tumor. In stage 3, it is spread to lymph nodes that are a little further away. So these are in the mediastinum, which is the middle of the chest here. And then in stage 4, it's spread to other organs. So that could be the other lung. It could be the brain or bone or some of the more common areas. And so one of the reasons why lung cancer is so deadly is that it doesn't cause symptoms until it's quite advanced most of the time. So people can be in stage 1 and have a small tumor, and they have plenty of normal lung, and they feel completely normal. And even in stage 2 and sometimes 3, people might even feel totally normal, as Doctor. Lin did for quite a while."

If it spreads to the spine, for example, someone might have back pain. And as was discussed, these symptoms are actually quite common. So someone who goes to their primary care physician and says, I have a cough, it could be a 1,000,000 different things that are not lung cancer. Same with back pain. Right?

So if you have a very early stage 1, and there are actually many subcategories of stages, so there's even stage 1A and B and 1A1, and, uh, it's very subclassified. But the very earliest stage, over 90% of people will be alive 5 years later, whereas that basically plummets. And in stage 4, it's less than 10% of people. Most people are diagnosed on this side because that's when they have symptoms and actually go to get evaluated by their primary care physician. So we have really tried to figure out how can we diagnose people on the early side before they have any symptoms, and that is called cancer screening or screening in general. So screening in general means that you're looking for a disease, in this case lung cancer, before it causes any symptoms. And so you are essentially performing a test on a healthy person. And so probably you've heard of more common screening tests like mammography for breast cancer or colonoscopies for colon cancer. Lung cancer screening is a lot newer."

They are basically asked just to take a deep breath and hold it for a few seconds so that nothing's moving as the, um, as they're scanning.

Um, just because I know some of you are not yet in medicine, um, so I just wanted to explain what a pack year was. This is how physicians can quantify the smoking history for each person. So we multiply the number of packs smoked per day on average by the number of years smoked. So the criteria for screening currently is 20 pack years. So you can actually arrive at 20 pack years with different types of smoking history. If someone smoked 1 pack per day for 20 years, they have 20 pack years. If someone smoked 2 packs per day for 10 years, that's also 20 pack years."

And this was, um, a multicenter trial run by the National Cancer Institute, and they enrolled over 50,000 people. You can see they were even heavier smokers. That was the original screening guidelines. And the, um, the participants were randomized to 3 annual screenings, either with the low dose CT scan or with just a plain chest X-ray. Um, and some of the key findings are here. Um, they detected lung cancer in 1.1% of people after the first scan, and half of those were in stage 1. So that's when we can cure people. And overall, after the 3 screenings, the lung cancer mortality decreased by 20%. So for every 320 low dose CT scans, they, um, calculated that we would prevent 1 lung cancer death.

So that's the I think, reporting and data system. Um, and so every lung nodule will be classified in one of these from 0 to 4 x depending on how suspicious it is. And you can see the estimated prevalence in the population, and then management depends on how suspicious things are. So if the lung nodule is likely benign, then we may just say get your usual annual LDCT in 1 year. If it's probably benign, we might say, come back earlier. Let's do it in 6 months because we don't want to let this grow if it is a cancer.

Overdiagnosis. So I think that's more rare in lung cancer, but it's possible that we find a nodule that is very slowly growing. So it wouldn't have hurt the person anyway, but because we found it, we treated it. Incidental findings, so other findings that lead to, um, tests that end up being benign potentially. The cost of the scan, both to the person and then us as a health care system.

But in Asian populations and Asian American populations, that could be really up to 80% in some racial and ethnic groups. And then finally, they could be round glass modules as well. So this is one small study that shows a little bit of the trends. This was a study out of Florida. So the numbers are small, but I think the trends are very clear. You can see that the, um, these are people, um, diagnosed with lung cancer and then the proportion or the percentage of never smokers in that group."

And compared to the Caucasian group all the way to the left, every Asian group has many a much higher percentage of never smokers all the way up above 80% in the Chinese group. And this is also, uh, reflected in the men as well in gray, but not to such a big extent. So a lot of people have been, um, trying to figure out why there's this big difference. And some of the things, you know, might make sense in terms of Asian culture, but it's very hard to parse out all of these really, um, personal details and risk factors that people have. So, um, it's probably multifactorial. We know that genetics must play some role in it. We know that people with a family history of lung cancer are more likely to have lung cancer, but there's no gene to test now. Secondhand smoke may be a factor. We know in a lot of Asian cultures, the men smoke a lot."

        "text": "So the women who are never smokers may actually have a lot of secondhand smoke exposure, um, air pollution, and then finally cooking oil fumes. There have been several studies that have showed an association with cooking on a stove, like stir frying, pan frying, deep frying, especially cooking without ventilation, without a hook. I'll skip this. It's a little into the weeds. And then I just wanted to give you an example of the ground glass nodules or part solid nodules that we see, um, quite frequently in never smokers who have lung cancer. And they'll often be a little wisp here you can see where it's, um, really not very dense and very similar to the lung parenchyma. And we know that people with these, they often grow very slowly. Yeah. And so this was, um, one of my patients, and the time frame was 3 years. And so you can see this is growing very slowly, um, but it is growing in size as well as density."

And so never smokers are more likely to have these types of nodules, which are more indolent lung cancers, and that will play into as we're developing any screening guidelines for people who've never smoked. We do have to balance the risks and benefits of the scans, and knowing that many patients have a slower growing cancer may affect how frequently we recommend screening. So Taiwan, um, well, I back up and say a lot of places in Asia are now offering screening. I think their health care system's very different, um, and they're much more likely to recommend scans. So I've had several patients who go to Asia to, um, uh, see their family or go back home and they go see a doctor. And even if they're much younger, even if they're never smokers, a lot of them are offered scans. And then they'll actually come back, um, and and want to get care close to home or close to family here."

Other ones were tuberculosis or other lung disease. And they got the low dose CT scan annually for 3 years and then every 2 years. And, um, interestingly, the detection rate for lung cancer was 2.1% after the first scan. So this is almost twice the number from the national lung screening trial, which enrolled heavy smokers. Half of them were stage 1. All but one were adenocarcinoma. And then of note that the detection rate was even higher in people who had a family history. And they enrolled both men and women."

Um, and so currently based on the TALENT study, Taiwan started an early detection program in 2022, and they are, um, screening men starting at age 50 and women starting at age 45, never smokers, but they require a family history. They found that was such a risk factor in the TALENT study. Those were the people that they were, um, starting to screen afterwards, And they're screening with a low dose CT every 2 years, so not as frequently as what is currently recommended for heavy smokers. So in the US, there's then one pilot study out of New York called the Female Asian Non Smoker Screening Study, or FANS, and their preliminary data for the first 200 patients or participants, um, so they enrolled women starting at age 40, which is quite young, never smokers identifying as from Asian, uh, descent, and they offered the LDCT every year for 3 years. And with their preliminary results after the first scan, their detection rate was 1.5 percent. So they found 3 people with lung cancer out of the first 201. All three had EGFR mutations and are taking EGFR inhibitors. And the detection rate for ground glass nodules, so these indolent, uh, lung nodules that"
