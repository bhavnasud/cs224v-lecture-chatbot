But since we cannot be certain of chronicity, we cannot rule out acute infection or malignancy.  Mediastinal lymphadenopathy and a right pleural effusion are possible.   Recommend a chest CT with contrast for better evaluation.\n \n \n \nMay 7, 2024\nIMPRESSION:\n \n1.  Large right superior perihilar consolidation, with associated right hilar, mediastinal, and supraclavicular necrotic lymphadenopathy. There is associated right segmental airway narrowing with probable postobstructive consolidation/pneumonia. While these findings may reflect multilobar pneumonia (possibly tuberculous given necrotic lymphadenopathy), there is high suspicion for malignancy. Consider referral to pulmonology for possible tissue diagnosis.\n \n2.  Small-moderate right pleural effusion and small pericardial effusion, which may be reactive or malignant in nature. \n \n3.  Scattered left-sided nonspecific solid pulmonary nodules measuring up to 6 mm in the lingula. Attention on follow-up imaging.\n \n4.  Results were communicated to Dr. Ford by Dr. Parivash on 5/8/2024 at 1551\nMay 8, 2024\nPathology  \nMay 10,2024\n1.  Numerous (approximately 50) enhancing lesions in the supratentorial and infratentorial parenchyma, concerning for intracranial metastases. Some of these lesions have mild perilesional edema. \n \n2.  13 x 9 mm dural based, hyperperfused, enhancing lesion along the superior aspect of the right tentorial leaflet with mild perilesional edema in the lingual gyrus, also favored to represent a dural metastasis, less likely an incidental meningioma.\n \n3.  Mildly heterogenous and decreased bone marrow signal in the visualized upper cervical spine, which may be red marrow reconversion.
