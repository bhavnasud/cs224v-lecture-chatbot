        "text": "Results: Fourteen studies met inclusion criteria for review. Barriers were grouped into three categories: healthcare provider and system factors, patient factors and disease factors. Conclusions: Studies showed that the most frequently reported barriers to early presentation and diagnosis of lung cancer reported by patients and carers related to poor relationships between GPs and patients, a lack of access to services and care for patients, and a lack of awareness of lung cancer symptoms and treatment. Addressing these barriers offers opportunities by which rates of early diagnosis of lung cancer may be improved."

        "text": "Keywords: Barrier to diagnosis, Early presentation, Lung cancer, Cancer care, Primary care, Delay to diagnosis Background Lung cancer is one of the most common causes of death from cancer worldwide [ 1]. It has been estimated that nearly one in five deaths globally are due to lung cancer, with 1.59 million deaths reported in 2012 (19.4% of the total). Overall survival rates for lung cancer are poor, with five year survival rates being 10 20% post diagnosis in most countries including New Zealand, Canada, Australia and Sweden [ 24]. A key reason for poor out- comes in lung cancer survival is the fact that it is typic- ally diagnosed at a late stage when the patient has presented with symptoms. Population based screening for early stage lung cancer using LDCT (low dosecomputerised tomography) has been shown to be effect- ive in identifying cases at an earlier stage and in redu- cing lung cancer mortality [ 5]. However, there is a high cost and a high false positive rate in using LDCT as a screening test [ 6]. Consequently uptake has been very slow and further research is ongoing in assessing whether there are particular high risk populations where screening for lung cancer can be justified."

Lung cancer symptoms can be different from person to person, and while most people show at least some early symptoms, some show none [ 8,9]. Moreover, symptoms particular to lung can- cer may be subtle and not directly related to the lungs and chest (e.g. tiredness and weight loss are sometimes the presenting symptom) [ 8,9].

Misinterpretation can be exacerbated by the existence of co-morbidities, which can result in delayed diagnosis or referral [ 1014]. Cross-cul- tural variations across nine countries have shown differ- ences in the delay in reporting symptoms, ranging from 7 days to 6 months [ 15]. Early recognition of lung cancer symptoms combined with early medical help seeking be- haviour can have the potential to increase survival and de- crease mortality from lung cancer [ 11,1618]. However, the proportion of patients who are identified with early stage cancer and receive curative surgery is low, with stud- ies showing a prevalence of between 15 and 20% [ 1922]."

        "text": "In saying this, recent research also points out that, al- though shortening of diagnostic intervals can result in clinical benefits for some patient groups (e.g. in terms of diagnosis and post-diagnosis cancer management in pri- mary care), for others, it may not necessarily translate to improved outcomes. This can be due to various broader reasons including the symptom signature of lung cancer [9] or the patients perception of their experience within the healthcare system [ 23]. Overall, to maximise patient survival from lung cancer, early detection remains an imperative factor, alongside prompt referral. It is therefore necessary to increase the proportion of patients diagnosed with early stage disease. However, numerous studies indicate that there are sig- nificant barriers towards help-seeking behaviour and diagnosis. The objective of this systematic review was to explore and document the barriers to early presentation and diagnosis of lung cancer, identified by patients and carers (including those specific to indigenous and ethnic minority groups)."

By including quantitative studies in our review, we would have risked being in danger of leaving out important themes voiced by patients themselves, as barriers identified based on quanti- tative surveys or questionnaires tend to be predetermined. Furthermore, our search did not extend to non-English language studies or grey literature. References cited in the selected studies and any literature reviews with broadly similar search criteria were searched for further relevant articles. Figure 1shows a flow chart of the process of selecting and including relevant studies for this review ac- cording to the PRISMA guidelines [ 24]. The inclusion of articles published only in peer reviewed journals was our first method of assessing the quality each study reviewed. The quality of each study was also assessed using the CASP checklist for qualita- tive research [ 25]. All studies yielded generally strong scores in the domains of validity, results and local rele- vance or value."

A number of studies that had multiple participant groups (i.e. patients, family members, GPs and other service providers), explored multiple types of cancer (i.e. lung, prostate, breast and colorectal), used mixed methods (both qualitative and quantitative), and had a primary focus that went beyond identifying barriers to early presentation and diagnosis (e.g. developing an intervention) were included, but noted accordingly.Cassim et al.

By screening article titles, 870 were deemed to be duplicates or irrelevant based on topic. The abstracts of the remaining 58 articles were screened, from which 21 were excluded as they examined other cancers, not including lung cancer. Full articles were assessed on the remaining 37 potential publications. Of these, 23 were excluded as they focused on lung cancer screening, they did not examine patient and carer perspectives of bar- riers to diagnosis and/or they were literature reviews or quantitative analyses. The remaining 14 articles were in- cluded in our review. The characteristics and results of the studies are summarised in Table 1."

Primarily, the quality of the relationship between GPs and patients was a recurring theme reported in many of the articles. For instance, a lack of an estab- lished relationship between patient and GP affected the quality of care provided to the patient. The quality of communication between the patient and GP resulted in a lack of established trust between patient and GP, a lengthy period of time before GPs took the patient s con- cerns seriously and inadequate information provided to patients [ 29,3336]. Such barriers were also exacerbated by a lack of GP continuity [ 35,36]. Specific barriers identified were, GPs nihilism towards lung cancer [ 36], and inability to understand or relate to tobacco addic- tion [ 33]. A New Zealand study also reported that a lack of openness to other (indigenous/ ethnic minor- ity) worldviews was a barrier to diagnosis of lung cancer [ 36]."

Patients additionally observed that limited access to health care (provider and services) was a barrier to diagnosis and care [ 10,30,34,36].

A key patient related barrier recurrent in the literature was normalisation, misattribution, misinterpretation, minimization or low risk perception of symptoms relating to lung cancer [ 1012,29, 30,33,35,36]. For instance, while many patients felt that respiratory symptoms and generalized ill-health were nor- mal for smokers, others felt that protective behaviours such as exercise or diet could offset health risk.

For instance, a key patient and carer perceived barrier relates to the rela- tionship between patients and GPs. Such relationships are crucial to presentation and diagnosis of lung cancer, as they affect the level of trust between GPs and pa- tients, patient attitudes towards their GP and vice versa, and patient perceived blame, stigma, lecturing and repri- manding by GPs [ 29,33,35,36]. Thus, barriers relating to the relationship between patients and GPs span both healthcare provider and system factors as well as patient factors. Additionally, this review provided evidence that issues relating to access, spanning both healthcare pro- vider and system factors and patient factors, was another key area that posed barriers to patients help-seeking be- haviour [ 10,26,28,32,34,36]. A lack of awareness of lung cancer symptoms and treatment was also identified as a significant barrier. Issues relating to a lack of awareness spanned healthcare provider and system factors, patient factors as well as disease factors, and affected patients, GPs and the general public [ 11,12,27,31,32,36]."

        "text": "There is a clear indication in the research of the press- ing need to increase lung cancer awareness, and to pro- vide resources and knowledge regarding symptoms and treatment to patients, healthcare providers and the gen- eral public. In particular, research by Tod et al. (2008) [11], included in this review, indicates that some infor- mation campaigns relating to lung cancer were seen to contribute to fatalistic views due to a focus on death ra- ther than treatment and/or survival. Since then, how- ever, various awareness campaigns about the early diagnosis and/or detection of lung cancer have been trialled in New Zealand, Australia [ 37], Scotland [ 26] and Doncaster, United Kingdom [ 38], some of which have resulted in an increase in at-risk patients intentions to see a GP and request a chest X-ray (e.g. [ 38]). The programme implemented in Doncaster, additionally in- volved a brief GP education intervention for primary care practices in high lung cancer risk localities, result- ing in an increase in chest X-rays and lung cancer diag- nosis [ 38]. In many countries, clinical guidelines andoptimal care pathways specific to lung cancer exist, aimed at increasing GP awareness of the disease (e.g. ac- cording to the Ministry of Health, New Zealand [ 39])."

        "text": "While such initiatives are promising, there is a need for replication, rigorous outcome evaluation [ 40], and to create a multi-pronged approach to raise lung cancer awareness [ 36]. The findings of this review, as well as that of quantitative, population level studies identifying patient perceived barriers to lung cancer diagnosis, both indicate that an inability to recognize symptoms and the stigma associated with lung cancer posed significant bar- riers to early diagnosis [ 4144]. Thus, there is also a need to provide education to patients about the risks and symptoms of lung cancer, to dispel negative (fatalis- tic and stigmatising) beliefs about the disease and out- come s, and to empower at-risk patients to get checked in primary care [ 36]. Such an approach needs to also in- volve a GP training or education element, as an increase in lung cancer awareness needs to occur in patients, the general public as well as GPs and other healthcare professionals."

        "text": "Delays within the system were also identified as a major barrier to presentation and diagnosis of lung can- cer. For instance, delays in getting appointments, in waiting times, in getting referrals, or getting a diagnosis, the distance and access to health care providers, as well as the financial aspects of cancer care (e.g. cost of treat- ment, patients socioeconomic status) hindered access to services, and thus timely diagnosis and treatment [10,2830,3436]. Similar findings were reported by Sood et al s (2009) [ 45] review of patients clinical records identifying barriers to diagnosis of lung can- cer. Delay, irrespective of reason, can be frustrating for many patients, and when combined with difficulties accessing information and services, could increase distress [46]. It is clear that a more patient-centred and accessible approach to cancer diagnosis and care is needed."

        "text": "Furthermore, many studies in our review did not re- port the ethnicity, or rather the ethnic variation, of their participants [ 1012,26,2931,3335]. In particular, Sharf et al. (in 2005) [ 35] and Tod et al. (in 2008) [ 11] indicated that the fact that their participant bases com- prised primarily white patients, rather than black or minority groups, was a limitation of their research. Con- sidering the poorer outcomes relating particularly to eth- nic minority and indigenous populations diagnosed with lung cancer [ 4752], the findings of this review imply that more qualitative research needs to be conducted and published with a specific focus on ethnic minority and indigenous groups. These findings also hold implica- tions for broader arguments emphasizing the importance of culture, and of acknowledging and respecting diverse worldviews, particularly in cancer care. For example, re- search from Australia (not included in this review),Cassim et al. BMC Cancer           (2019) 19:25 Page 11 of 14 indicates that a lack of cultural competence by GPs was a significant barrier to early presentation and diagnosis of cancer [ 5356]. Such conclusions are consistent with the statements of M ori participants in Walton et al s [36] New Zealand study, which indicated that a GP s lack of respect for, and openness to other (indigenous/ethnic minority) worldviews posed a significant barrier to help-seeking behaviour."

In saying this, it is important to recognise that a healthcare professional s cultural understanding of, and engagement with a pa- tient should not be reduced to a simple set of technical skills acquired solely through cultural competency train- ing [58]. Accordingly, the findings of this review reiterate the importance of the need for a focus on building rela- tionships between patient and GP. As such, the Austra- lian studies report that many Aboriginal Australians hold differing health beliefs of cancer causation [ 5356]."

Accordingly, these researchers indicate that there needs to be an ac- knowledgement of such differing worldviews by the broader healthcare system, and that GPs need to also be aware of the significance of traditional healing methods germane to each of these communities [ 54,56]. While we acknowledge that not all indigenous communities are the same, there is need for health professionals to have knowledge of, and/or experience in, not only medicine, but also the communities they serve, which goes beyond a simple set of skills acquired through cultural compe- tency training. Overall, more attention needs to be paid to identifying and addressing barriers to early presenta- tion and diagnosis of lung cancer among indigenous communities."

A limitation of this review was that it only examined studies published inEnglish. However, the consistency of results identified in these studies provides some reassurance as to their val- idity. Studies reviewed were also from a limited number of countries. Research from countries that are not con- sidered First World nations may have contributed sig- nificantly to our findings. Moreover, we documented only the perceived barriers identified by patients and carers. Patients and carers are the most valid source for identifying barriers to early presentation and diagnosis of lung cancer. However, understanding GP views along- side population level data may be necessary in order to introduce effective interventions."

        "text": "Conclusion Early presentation and detection of symptoms relating to lung cancer is critical to improving survival. Delays in early presentation and diagnosis of lung cancer might be avoided if various barriers relating to healthcare provider and system factors as well as patient and disease factors are addressed. This paper provides a complete, exhaust- ive summary of current patient-centred evidence identi- fying the existent barriers to early diagnosis of lung cancer, by bringing together and reviewing 14 qualitative studies from various countries. According to the findings of our review, a good starting point to addressing patient and carer perceived barriers, is to focus on the three key areas of relationship building between GP and patient, improving patient access to services and care, and in- creasing awareness of lung cancer symptoms and treat- ment, particularly among disadvantaged communities."
