We used chi-square tests and logistic regression analysis to test for associations between the primary outcome and languagetype, region type, hospital teaching status, and cancer care requested.We used multivariable logistic regression analysis to determine factors associated with simulated patient callers being provided the next steps. Results: Of the 1,296 calls, 52.9% (n 5686) resulted in simulated patient callers being provided next steps to access cancer care.

J Natl Compr Canc Netw 2023;21(9):951 959.e1 doi:10.6004/jnccn.2023.7037Background Despite a decline in cancer incidence and mortality rates in the United States, there continues to be an unequal burden of cancer among racial and ethnic minorities.1,2 Prior work has demonstrated disparities in access to high- volume physicians, receipt of cancer treatment, and cancer-specic survival. 312However, although the eld of cancer disparities has grown, granular data on cancer care deliverycontinue to be derived from studies with predominantlyEnglish-speaking patients. Patients with limited English pro ciency (LEP) re- main underrepresented in the literature addressing can- cer disparities, even though there are .25 million LEP individuals in the United States, an increase of 80% since1990. 13,14Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 provides legal protection against discrimination on the basis ofrace, color, and national origin."

Thus, studies such as this one are needed to improve our understanding oflinguistic barriers to cancer care access. Strengths of our study include the focus on the 3 most common spokenlanguages in the United States and on 3 cancer types that are highly relevant to the patient populations that speak those languages, 31,34,35and the inclusion of hospi- tals from 12 demographically diverse states. The multiple sensitivity analyses performed were another strength of the study, although the new cohort was smaller and therefore it is possible that some of the subsequent re- sults were no longer statistically signi cant due to a smaller cohort size."

First, we only assessed responses from the hospital general infor- mation telephone line, and as such, the ndings do not reect the type or quality of cancer care a patient may re- ceive once seen and treated at the hospital. However, the audit survey methodology mirrors the patient experience of seeking to access cancer care. Second, our study nd- ings may not be generalizable to all non English-speaking patients with cancer. It is likely that patients who speak other less commonly spoken non-English languages or who reside in regions with a very small LEP population (ie, LEP population of ,120,000 in the state) face even greater bar- riers to accessing cancer care than those identi ed in our study. Third, our study does not capture the complexities of hospital call center work ows, and thus, we are limited in our ability to ascertain the reasons behind the observed outcomes of the telephone calls. Thus, future qualitative work is needed to explore differences in hospital call center workows and their relationship to cancer care access."

Our study highlights the important yet understudied systems-level barriers thatcontributes to disparities in access to cancer care. Thus, al- though interventions focused on improving communication between physicians and LEP patients in the postdiagnosis stages are necessary, it is not adequate to fully address can- cer disparities. Because disparities in cancer care for LEP pa- tients start prior to the physician patient visit, there is a critical need for interventions focused on improving access to cancer care for these patients. To address barriers at the level of the hospital general information telephone line and interpreter services, hospital general information telephone lines that default to an automatic message should connect callers to a live person when no input is entered, instead of disconnecting; hospitals that serve a signi cant LEP patientTable 3.

It is essential that we take a critical look at our healthcare system andengage in efforts to mitigate these communication barriersthat disproportionately impact the health of vulnerable pa-tient populations with cancer. All patients with cancershould have access to high-quality medical and surgicalcare, regardless of English language pro ciency.Acknowledgments The authors thank Brittany Gay, Cyndi Gonzales, and Ariel Jean for their assistance with data collection.
