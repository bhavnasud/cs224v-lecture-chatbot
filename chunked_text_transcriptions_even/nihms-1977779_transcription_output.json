Smoking-related lung cancers account for the majority  of lung cancer diagnoses and continue to claim ~100,000 lives in the USA each year1;  however, smoking rates have been decreasing for several decades. Although varying widely  across the USA, cigarette smoking prevalence among adults reached an all-time low at  11.5% in 2021 (ref. 2), down by more than two-thirds (from ~42%) since the first Surgeon  Generals Report linking cigarette smoking to lung cancer and heart disease in 1964 (ref. 3) (Fig. 1a) and is projected to fall further to 7.5% overall by 2065 (ref. 4). As smoking  prevalence has declined, some reports indicate that the proportion of lung cancers occurring  in individuals who have never smoked (LCINS) has increased, particularly among women  and in younger age groups5. In 2023, >20,000 lung cancer-related deaths in the USA were  projected to occur in people who have never smoked1, making LCINS the eighth leading  cause of cancer-related mortality in the USA; data suggest that LCINS is currently the fifth  most common cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide6 (Fig. 1b)."

Moreover, several studies have revealed  that LCINS are also genomically and molecularly distinct from smoking-related lung  cancers, highly enriched for targetable oncogenic alterations (such as EGFR  mutations  or ALK  rearrangements as well as less common alterations), and thus often require  different diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. Over the past decade, new data have emerged  regarding the genetic risk of LCINS, conferred by both common and rare germline  variants, as well as environmental risk factors and potential interactions between the two. Conceivably, LCINS could eventually become the most common form of lung cancer,  necessitating a thorough understanding of its pathogenesis and risk factors. Herein, we  review the epidemiological, clinical and genomic features of LCINS, along with data from  studies examining both genetic and environmental risk factors, as well as diagnostic and  treatment strategies."

Definitions of smoking status have varied;  however, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and others have previously used  the term never-smoker (or sometimes non-smoker) to refer to individuals who have  smoked <100 cigarettes in their lifetime, and LCINS is defined as lung cancer arising in  such individuals.

A current smoking status refers to individuals who  have smoked >100 cigarettes in their lifetime and who still report smoking every day or  some days. Nevertheless, data from several studies suggest that smoking history should be  quantified as a continuous rather than discrete variable, supported by findings such as the  likelihood of a lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) harbouring an EGFR  mutation decreasing as  number of pack-years increases10. As discussed below, the discovery of tumour mutational  signatures corresponding to tobacco smoking might eventually help to delineate what  constitutes a clinically significant level of exposure from a genomic perspective."

The proportion of lung cancers attributable to tobacco smoking varies across  countries, at >80% in men and women in the USA and the UK1214, and 57.5% in men  and 13% in women in China15. A never-smoking status is more frequent among female  patients in Asia than those in other regions and, interestingly, >55% of female Asian  patients and >30% of Hispanic female patients diagnosed with non-small-cell lung cancer  (NSCLC) in the USA have never smoked16. However, even when compared specifically  with non-smoking women in other geographical regions, lung cancer incidence rates have  been observed to be higher among women in East Asia17, suggesting that genetic and/or  environmental factors other than tobacco smoke exposure contribute to the global variation  in the prevalence of LCINS."

Newer strategies involving TKI treatment to the point of  maximal response followed by local consolidative treatment are under investigation322 325 as are upfront combinations of targeted agents with chemotherapy in patients with  advanced-stage disease326. For patients with central nervous system metastases at diagnosis  but without severe mass effects and in whom a targetable alteration is found for which a  central nervous system-penetrant TKI is available, potential therapeutic strategies include  TKI treatment prior to radiotherapy or surgical resection of brain lesions given the high  intracranial efficacy of these drugs in clinical trials; however, comparisons with upfront  radiotherapy and/or surgery have not yet been made. Ongoing or completed clinical trials  have also incorporated targeted therapies in the neoadjuvant and adjuvant settings327330."

In individuals with an elevated germline risk of cancer, screening has an important role  in disease prevention. Low-dose CT (LDCT) screening has been shown to reduce lung  cancer mortality332,333 but is only approved for individuals 50 years of age with a current  or recent heavy smoking status. Future efforts in the LCINS space include identifying a  population with elevated germline and/or exposure-mediated risk to prioritize for LDCT  screening (for example, individuals carrying large-effect rare variants associated with  familial EGFR -mutant lung cancer), with studies already under way (such as NCT05587439 LoPiccolo et al.

These individuals might benefit from germline genetic testing and  carriers of pathogenic variants might also benefit from LDCT screening as part of future  changes to clinical care.

        "text": "Investigations with specific attention to smoking history are therefore paramount both  for determining the global and national trends in LCINS epidemiology, and establishing  registries with detailed exposure histories. Advances have been made in understanding  LCINS biology at the somatic exome and genome levels, yet the germline contribution  remains largely unexplored and large-scale sequencing studies in diverse populations are  needed to define germline genetic risk. Furthermore, our understanding of environmental  carcinogens continues to evolve, and future directions for research should include the  mechanisms driving carcinogenesis mediated by non-tobacco-related exposures, such as  environmental pollution, and their interaction with underlying germline variation. The  biological distinctions between LCINS and smoking-related lung cancers necessitate a  unique approach to diagnosis and treatment, with integration of environmental exposures  and both germline and somatic genetics to deliver precision oncology strategies for the  treatment and prevention of this increasingly important disease."

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Key points  The global incidence of lung cancer is decreasing in parallel with declining  smoking rates in developed countries; however, the incidence of lung cancer  in individuals who have never smoked (LCINS) is stable or increasing.  LCINS is the eighth leading cause of cancer-related mortality in the USA and  the fifth most common cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide.  LCINS has histological and epidemiological distinctions from smoking- related lung cancers, occurring almost exclusively as adenocarcinomas and  most commonly in women and individuals of Asian ancestry."

Moreover, germline variants affecting carcinogen metabolism,  DNA repair and inflammatory processes can interact with environmental exposures and  thereby influence the acquisition of somatic alterations and tumour development, and  polymorphisms in genes underlying drug metabolism can affect responses to therapy or  the development of treatment-related toxicities (the concept of pharmacogenomics). b,  Risk factors promoting LCINS include environmental exposures such as radon, secondhand  smoke, outdoor (air) and indoor (household) pollution, occupational carcinogens, and prior  radiotherapy to the chest.

Emerging therapeutic biomarkers  include high-level MET  amplification, with the current NCCN Guidelines (version 5.2023)  noting that thresholds constituting high-level MET amplification are evolving; when next- generation sequencing (NGS) is used, a MET  copy number of 10 is consistent with  high-level MET  amplification and is associated with clinical benefit from MET tyrosine  kinase inhibitors. Although NGS is the preferred analytical modality, molecular profiling  is defined as broad testing that identifies all relevant clinically actionable biomarkers in  either a single assay or a combination of a limited number of assays and, ideally, also  identifies emerging biomarkers.

WHO has estimated that ~6% of outdoor air pollution-related premature deaths in  2016 were due to lung cancer268; associations with lung cancer risk and mortality have been  demonstrated in individuals who have smoked and those who have not (HR < 2)265,267,271,272,  and air pollution-associated lung cancer risk is probably influenced by underlying genetic  susceptibility265,278; PM 2.5 levels positively correlated with rates of EGFR -mutant lung cancer in  England, South Korea and Taiwan279261265,268,276 279,346 Electronic  cigarettes/ vapingThe carcinogenic potential of electronic cigarette/vaping particles is not currently known and is  probably dependent on the composition of aerosolized liquid, the device and user habits302304;  long-term follow-up studies are required to determine any lung cancer risk302308,347349 Household use  of solid fuels  and high- temperature  fryingFumes and particulate matter generated from cooking and heating contain group 1 (carcinogenic)  or group 2 (likely carcinogenic) substances as defined by the WHO IARC; doseresponse  relationships between reported exposure to cooking oil fumes and lung cancer risk have been  demonstrated; in Chinese non-smoking women, the ORs are as high as 6.15 in the highest exposure  groups (higher with deep frying versus stir-frying and in homes with poor ventilation)311313;  indoor burning of coal, wood and other biomass is associated with an increased risk of lung cancer  with ORs <2, with greater levels of risk in women than in men315,316,350310316,350 Diet No consistent data exist that implicate dietary differences as being associated with lung cancer  risk; primary chemoprevention studies focused on lung cancer have not demonstrated benefit  from dietary supplements, although some studies have shown an association between -carotene  supplementation and a reduced risk of lung cancer in men who have smoked351353351355 HRT Findings regarding the association between HRT and lung cancer risk are mixed; data from  the Womens Health Initiative trial demonstrated no statistically significant increase in the risk  of lung cancer with either oestrogenprogestin or oestrogen-only HRT356358; however, results  of the Vitamins and Lifestyle study indicate an increased risk of lung cancer with oestrogen progestin HRT after adjusting for smoking status (HR 1.48 if exposed to 10 years oestrogen plus  progestin)35978,356364 Prior and/or  chronic lung  diseaseA history of lung disease (COPD, pneumonia, tuberculosis or interstitial lung disease) is associated  with an increased risk of lung cancer365370, although the associations are confounded by  tobacco smoking and other environmental exposures; an elevated lung cancer risk associated with  emphysema, pneumonia and tuberculosis has been observed consistently in white men367; the  underlying mechanisms are presumed to be related to chronic inflammation and parenchymal lung  injury; whether autoimmune diseases are associated with an increased risk of developing lung  cancer in individuals who do not smoke remains unclear365375 Nat Rev Clin Oncol .
