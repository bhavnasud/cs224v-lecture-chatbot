There are currently no clinical quality measures that are routinely used to measure the quality or timeliness of diagnosis of lung cancer in the US. We used Natural Language Processing (NLP) to extract information on the symptoms and signs that had been recorded in the electronic medical records of patients presenting in ambulatory care over the 2 years prior to their diagnosis with lung cancer. We found that the time from the rst recorded symptoms/signs associated with lung cancer to diagnosis was 570 days. The time intervals from chest CT or chest X-ray imaging to diagnosis, and from specialist consultation to diagnosis were shorterat 43 and 72 days, respectively. Advanced techniques such as NLP can be used to extract detailed information from electronic medical records, that could potentially be used to create clinical quality measures with the goal of improving the timeliness of diagnosis of this cancer."

We describe the pre- diagnostic time intervals among a retrospective cohort of 711 patients identied with primary lung cancer from 20122019 from ambulatory care clinics in Seattle, Washington USA. Electronic health record data were extracted for two years prior to diagnosis, and Natural Language Processing (NLP) applied to identify symptoms/signs from free text clinical elds. Time points were dened for initial symptomatic presentation, chest imaging, specialist consultation, diagnostic conrmation, and treatment initiation. Median and interquartile ranges (IQR) were calculated for intervals spanning these time points.

Introduction Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer-related death in the United States (US) with 5-year survival rates for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and small cell lung cancer (SCLC) of 25% and 7%, respectively [ 1]. While early stage lung cancer can often be treated surgically, ninety percent of those diagnosed with lung cancer will die of the disease in part due to late-stage (Stages III or IV) presentation and lethality of this disease [ 2]. Prognosis largely reects stage at diagnosis, with 5-year survival rates for early stage localized lung cancer of 63% and 27% for late-stage lung cancer [1]."

        "text": "While screening asymptomatic individuals for lung cancer using low dose computed tomography (LDCT) in high-risk patients has been recommended in the US since 2012 [ 3], uptake has been limited and most individuals with lung cancer are diagnosed following symptomatic presentation [ 4,5]. Detection of potential lung cancer among symptomatic individuals is challenging as their symptoms are difcult to distinguish from more com- mon conditions [ 68]. Moreover, the time interval from symptom onset to diagnosis of lung cancer can be considerable; a study of over 48,000 patients using Medicare claims identied a median interval from symptom onset to diagnosis of 187 days (2575% IQR 36308 days) [ 9]. The long pre-diagnosis time interval for symptomatic lung cancer may be a target for quality improvement interventions with the aim of earlier detection. Notably, diagnostic errors related to lung cancer are among the most common causes of major malpractice claims in outpatient settings [10,11]."

The World Health Organization, for example, has set a goal of 90 days from symptom onset to treatment of lung cancer [ 12], while guidelines in Canada recommend time from presentation to diagnosis should be a maximum of four weeks [ 13,14]. In Denmark, clinical quality indicators have been used for more than 20 years to improve a range of outcome indicators for lung cancer [ 15]. However, despite the signicant potential opportunities to improve care in the US [ 16], there are no CQMs focused on the timeliness of diagnosis of lung cancer currently used in the US."

Current gaps in dening a CQM include how to dene and operationalize key timepoints in the pre-diagnosis period using electronic health record (EHR) data, as well as dening expected ranges for time intervals. The overall aim of this study was therefore to dene key time points and describe intervals in the diagnostic pathway of patients with lung cancer based on a single site in the US, from initial symptomatic presentation in ambulatory care to diagnosis, using routine EHR data. We believe our ndings provide valuable new information that not only describe the timeliness of the diagnostic process for lung cancer, but could also potentially be used to inform efforts to develop CQM for lung cancer in a range of health care settings Cancers 2022 ,14, 5756 3 of 18 2. Methods 2.1. Study Design A retrospective cohort of patients who received ambulatory care at UW Medicine (UWM), a health system afliated with the University of Washington (Seattle, Washington) with a diagnosis of a rst, primary lung cancer [ 17].

Participants Eligible patients were 18 years and older, with a rst primary lung cancer diagnosed between 1 January 201231 December 2019, who had an established relationship with UWM ambulatory care, and chest computed tomography (CT) performed at UWM prior to their rst recorded lung cancer diagnostic code. An ambulatory care relationship was dened as the presence of at least one visit to the following department specialties in the 24 months prior to the rst recorded lung cancer diagnostic code: family medicine, internal medicine, womens health, obstetrics and gynecology, urgent care, and/or emergency medicine. The requirements for ambulatory care relationship and chest CT were used to ensure that patients had received pre-diagnostic care and conrmatory imaging within UWM, rather than referrals from outside healthcare systems (e.g., only for specialty care). 2.3. Data Collection Data were collected through the UWM enterprise-wide data warehouse (EDW), a secure central repository that integrates EHR data across UWM. The EDW was queried for patients with lung cancer identied by ICD 9 or 10 diagnostic codes during the study period."

Extracted data included demographics (smoking status, age, sex, race, ethnicity), all ICD 9 or 10 diagnostic and Current Procedural Termi- nology (CPT) codes linked to encounters, as well as unstructured clinical notes for any of the above encounters. Study records from the EDW were then linked to the Seattle/Puget Sound Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program cancer registry which provided history of previous cancers, histology, date and stage of diagnosis, and date of initial treatment."

Sociodemographic Variables & Comorbidity The UWM data were used to determine age at diagnosis, sex, race and ethnicity, and smoking status (ever smoker dened as current or past smoking; never smoker dened as no history of any smoking). SEER registry provided data on health insurance and poverty which used the Census Tract Poverty Indicator to categorize individuals residence into categories of 10%, 15%, or 20% of people in the census tract living below the federally dened poverty line [ 18]. Comorbidity was calculated using the Elixhauser comorbidity index (ECI) [ 19]; ICD 9 and 10 diagnostic codes in the 2 years prior to lung cancer diagnosis were searched for 31 potential comorbidities. The sum and type of comorbidity were used to calculate van Walraven weighted score for each patient [ 20,21]. Patients who had low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) lung cancer screening within the 12 months prior to diagnosis date were identied from codes for LDCT screening linked specically to billing codes (CPT 71271 and G0297) and/or ICD code (V76.0 [ICD-9] or Z12.2 [ICD-10]) in patients without a lung cancer diagnosis prior to that visit."

Date of rst symptomatic presentation was based on the presence of symptoms or signs that have previously been identied as signicantly associated with the presence of lung cancer compared to matched controls from the same population [ 17]. These were: nger clubbing, lymphadenopathy, cough, hemoptysis, chest crackles or wheeze, weight loss, back pain, bone pain, shortness of breath, fatigue or chest pain. We used two approaches to identify these clinical features from the EHR in the 2 years prior to diagnosis: (1) ICD9/10 codes matched to the above clinical features, (2) Application of a natural language processing (NLP) framework to extract these clinical features from the unstructured data found in the free text of clinical notes [25]."

Groupwise comparisons using chi-square for categorical variables and t test for continuous variables were performed to determine signicant differences. The van Walraven weighted score [ 20,21] was calculated using the comorbidity package in R. We calculated time intervals in days for each patient and summarized these using mean, standard deviation (SD), median, and interquartile range (IQR). Intervals calculated included: rst clinical presentation to initial chest imaging (chest X-ray or chest CT) (timepoint A to B), rst clinical presentation to referral/encounter with specialist (timepoint A to C), and rst clinical presentation to diagnosis (timepoint A to D). Intervals were also categorized by stage (early stages I/II vs. late stages III/IV) and type of cancer (SCLC vs. NSCLC). Analyses were conducted using RStudio (Version 1.4.1106, RStudio, Inc., Boston, MA, USA) and the Statsmodels package (version 0.11.1) for Python 3.7 [ 30].

This may explain why we identied earlier documentation of symp- toms/signs potentially associated lung cancer than previous studies that did not use NLP methods. Interviews with patients who have recalled their early clinical presentations of lung cancer have highlighted a period of months or years prior to diagnosis, where individuals describe bodily changes, which may initially be dismissed or not attributed to cancer by patients or health care providers due to lack of awareness or fear of illness [ 3539].

Strengths and Limitations This is the rst study in the US which has dened key diagnostic time intervals using EHR data and applied NLP to extract symptoms/signs that could be related to lung cancer prior to diagnosis. The cohort is representative of individuals who receive care in ambulatory settings in Washington State. We used a broad denition of ambulatory care, which included primary care and emergency medicine, reecting US healthcare where some patients lack primary care providers. Our cohort is similar in terms of age, stage at diagnosis, and cancer type to studies from primary care settings in other countries [ 45]. In addition, the rates of lung cancer detected with LDCT screening we observed are consistent with contemporaneous data of screening rates of 3.9% among eligible adults [ 46]. Using NLP to extract details of symptoms and clinical features provided more detailed descriptions of clinical presentations than would have been possible using either coded or claims data alone as used in previous research [ 17].

This is important as there is evidence of disparities in cancer diagnosis among rural and other underserved communities in the US [ 49]. In addition, our study is based on a cohort from a single site, Cancers 2022 ,14, 5756 12 of 18 which further limits its generalizability. Second, while we attempted to extract all available EHR records on the cohort, patients may have entered or exited the UWM system during the study period due to changing health insurance and/or residence, and thus we may not have accessed the entirety of their health records [ 50]. Missing data due to care received at non-UWM sites could have altered the time intervals. However, we took special care to exclude patients as non-informative who may not have received their pre-diagnosis care at UWM. Furthermore, NLP extraction is limited by performance of the annotation tool used and what the provider documents, which could vary widely from provider to provider."

Study Implications Most ambulatory care providers receive little feedback on their diagnostic performance for serious (but rare) conditions such as cancer; a CQM could help to inform practitioner and clinic-wide efforts to improve practice. Our study demonstrates that key clinical features are recorded by clinicians in the EHR for a considerable period prior to diagnosis among patients who are later diagnosed with lung cancer. Tools could be implemented in EHR data to ag clinical signs that raise the probability of lung cancer, potentially using sophisticated models, although this would need to be balanced with the risks of unnecessary investigations and referrals. The time intervals we describe, if validated by other research, could inform upper limits of intervals for several steps in the pre-diagnosis period as part of a CQM. Interventional studies will be needed to determine the impacts of such measures on time to diagnosis, stage, overall survival as well as unintended negative impacts on healthcare utilization. However, we found few differences in symptoms/signs with stage at diagnosis; other studies suggest the symptom burden is indeed higher in patients with more advanced stage but that there may not be an association between longer diagnostic interval and later stage disease [52,53]."

Our ndings suggest that many patients have a long symptomatic period, prior to diagnostic testing and specialty visits, suggesting potential for interventions to improve timeliness of diagnosis, and potential for improving outcomes. Efforts are needed to develop and test interventions that can be applied in ambulatory care settings to improve the detection of individuals with lung cancer.
