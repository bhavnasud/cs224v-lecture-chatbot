Transl Lung Cancer Res  2018;7(4):450-463 tlcr.amegroups.comIntroduction Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths  in China and accounted for an estimated 610,000 deaths  in 2015 (1). The majority of lung cancers are thought  to be attributed to direct tobacco exposure. However,  approximately 10% to 25% of all lung cancers occur  in never smokers (2,3) , defined as those who smoked  fewer than 100 cigarettes during their lifetime. Notably,  epidemiologic studies reveal that the proportion of lung  cancer in never smokers (LCINS) is higher in East Asia,  including China, Japan, Mongolia, North Korea, and South Korea, and approximately one third of all lung cancer  patients are LCINS [39.7% in China (our unpublished  data), 38% in South Korea (4) and 32.8% in Japan (5)]. The  high proportion of LCINS is mainly due to low smoking  prevalence of East Asian females with lung cancer [9.9% in  South Korea, 1725.6% in Japan, 28.3% in Hong Kong,  6.4% in T aiwan, and 5.2% in China (our unpublished data)],  which was significantly lower than that in Caucasian female  patients (ranging from 53% to 91%) (4-10) . Meanwhile,  the smoking rate of male patients with lung cancer is  similar between East Asia and Western countries ( Figure 1 )  Review Article Lung cancer in never smokersthe East Asian experience Fei Zhou, Caicun Zhou Department of Oncology, Shanghai Pulmonary Hospital, T ongji University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200433, China Contributions:  (I) Conception and design: All authors; (II) Administrative support: All authors; (III) Provision of study materials or patients: All  authors; (IV) Collection and assembly of data: All authors; (V) Data analysis and interpretation: All authors; (VI) Manuscript writing: All authors; (VII)  Final approval of manuscript: All authors."

EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI) treatment has been the most important targeted  therapy in lung adenocarcinoma from East Asian never-smokers as approximately 70% of these patients  have the opportunity to receive EGFR-TKI treatment. Lung squamous cell carcinoma (SQCC) and small  cell lung cancer (SCLC) are two common histologic types of smoking-related non-small cell lung cancer  (NSCLC). The proportion of never-smokers with SQCC and SCLC in East Asian patients seems to be  higher than that in Caucasian patients. Recent studies also suggest that lung SQCC and SCLC in never- smokers may be distinct subtypes. Therefore, better understanding of the biologic characteristics of these  subtypes of patients may provide new insights for the treatment. In this review, we will provide an overview  of East Asian experience in the treatment of advanced, never-smoking lung cancer, focusing on etiologic  factors in the development of LCINS, targeted therapy for never-smokers with adenocarcinoma, distinct  characteristics of never-smokers with lung SQCC and SCLC, and the role of immunotherapy in never- smokers with NSCLC."

Although  tremendous efficacy has been achieved in these patients  with the administration of targeted therapy, the survival  outcomes are not satisfactory. Whether checkpoint  inhibitors can generate a durable response of these  patients, therefore, becomes of great importance. However,  recent randomized trials and meta-analysis revealed that  patients with EGFR  mutations did not derive survival  benefit from checkpoint inhibitors (128-132,138) . A  recent retrospective study also demonstrated that EGFR   mutations or ALK  rearrangement was associated with low  response to checkpoint inhibitors (3.6%, 1/28) (139) . The  poor response to checkpoint inhibitors in patients with  EGFR  mutations or ALK  rearrangement may result from a  potentially immunosuppressive microenvironment in these  patients (139) . EGFR  mutation was also correlated with  uninflamed phenotype and weak immunogenicity, with  decreased PD-L1 expression, lack of T-cell infiltration, and  lower TMB (140) . A recent report showed that High CD73  expression in EGFR -mutant NSCLC may be another cause  that contribute to the reduced benefit from checkpoint  inhibitors, which can alter immune cell function and is  correlated with low PD-L1 expression (141) . Sabari et al  recently reported preliminary results of immunotherapy  in NSCLC with MET ex14 skipping (142) . However, only  1 patient (6.7%, 1/15) responded to checkpoint inhibitors  and median PFS was only 2.3 months.

Never-smokers are  more often diagnosed with adenocarcinoma in East Asian,  a subtype largely defined by oncogenic drivers.

Lung SQCC  and SCLC are two common histologic type of smoking- related NSCLC. The incidence of LCINS also increases  over time in East Asian patients. Recent studies suggest  that lung SQCC and SCLC in never-smokers may be  distinct subtypes, and better understanding of the biologic  characteristics of these subtypes of patients may provide  new insights for the treatment of these patients. Although  Immunotherapy with immune checkpoint blockade  generates durable response in some patients with advanced  NSCLC, lung adenocarcinoma from East Asian never- smokers do not seem to be the beneficial population. These  findings may reflect the considerably lower total mutation  burden (and thus fewer neoantigens) in never smokers."
