So it's solving one set of problems, but it's creating a different set of problems. So the affordability, just to have us think of there's 2 sides to the affordability and true for health systems as well of how they manage the basics of where the dollars come from, how they use them, how the resources get together. And the accessibility, a number of you touched on, some of that is about accessibility, about location and geography, but even around availability, one of the things we did a lot in the pandemic is, so at Stanford prior to, and Brian knows as well, prior to the pandemic, hadn't arrived here yet, but prior to the pandemic, uh, take a guess at what percentage of kind of clinic visits were done through now what we call video visits."

And having come from one of them, that was a lot of what allowed some of the growth of different programs, both from a school of nursing, school of dentistry, school of pharmacy, school of medicine, advanced practice areas, and others. So the state schools are very tied to the strategy of the state level because the resources obviously help support them in both directions.

Maybe the therapy would start while they were still in the hospital, be a 3 week hospitalization. So much of cancer care now, I've watched this in my own practice the last 25 years in the hospital, things we used to take care of in the hospital almost rarely see the hospital. Now when they come to the hospital, it's from all the unfortunate complications and the progression of the disease. Most at this stage, as Brian's already demonstrated to you, you never even see the inside of a hospital."

As Bryants alluded to, I always say this for many patients, the hardest part is the waiting part. It's the uncertainty, it's the waiting to know what it is, what it's not, what it's gonna mean. So we've set up a diagnostic clinic specifically for patients who don't yet have a diagnosis but a high suspicion for. And it allows that centralized clinic to basically help shepherd patients through the process."

Believe me, from a policy perspective, I wish that was not the case, but that is the case. And so, as you're going out and voting and you're hearing and learning about what's happening in legislation, this is the impact you can see in different ways.

The other part of cancer that I'll also point out that our cancer team thinks a lot about is we now have 8 or 9 different sites across the Bay Area. So again, this idea of location. You know, how do we make the access easier because so much of cancer has gotten so specialized and as Brian also knows well, um, we talk a lot about clinical trials and I and many of the folks that specialize in cancer often say clinical trials are not about research, clinical trials are clinical care. And we know what happens as patients get opportunities to participate in clinical trials is that the care allows us to continue evolving and getting better."
