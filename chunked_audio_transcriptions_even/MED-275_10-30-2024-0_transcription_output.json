I'm Doctor. Stanley Liang, a retired Kaiser physician from the Department of Infectious Diseases. At age 58, 5 years ago, I was diagnosed to have lung cancer due to eGFR mutation. I was totally asymptomatic at the time."

        "text": "I have no family history. I never smoked, and the lung lesion was picked up on a chest X-ray that I did for positive PPD. The final pathology revealed that the cancer has spread to the methastinum, giving me a stage IIIA diagnosis. I underwent lobectomy, radiation, chemotherapy, as well as oxymetinib, a targeted therapy for 3 years, which I finished in, uh, end of 2023. Uh, in May of this year, uh, I underwent surveillance, and the cancer has recurred and has spread to the spine and also the left adrenal gland. Uh, I was put back on a regimen consisting of targeted therapy as well as chemotherapeutic agents. Uh, I want to share this story with you, uh, to increase awareness. I was shocked by the experience. I was shocked a lot because I developed cancer. I was shocked because I am I I never smoke. I'm totally asymptomatic, and I don't have any family history, and I'm diagnosed to have lung cancer. Thank you for your attention. My lung cancer was detected instantly during a workup for fishbone. What happened was 3 months ago. I had persistent right neck pain for 10 days. I remember that I swallowed fishbone about 10 days ago. Since I'm radiologist, I went to get neck x-ray to look for fishbone."

        "text": "My neuroradiology colleague looked at the x-ray and saw something but wasn't sure if it's a fishbone or just some normal calcification. So she recommended neck CT. On the neck CT, there was 1.5 centimeter nodule in the left lung apex, which was found to be adenocarcinoma on biopsy. 2 months ago, I was operated successfully by Doctor. Vallarta, and I got back to work full time 3 weeks ago. I think I'm just super lucky and blessed. The lung cancer was detected at early stage. By the way, in case if anybody was wondering what happened to the fishbone, actually there was no fishbone on the neck CT, and my neck pain went away right after I saw the nodule on the neck CT. Ask you we got a couple minutes left. Oh, I could have one maybe one minute left. So we've got this talent study. Yeah. Right? Not covered by"
