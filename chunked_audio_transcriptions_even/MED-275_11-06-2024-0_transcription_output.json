But, uh, so there is a practice that I'm sure many of you have heard of. So this is within the realm of positive psychology. There's actually a few evidence based interventions in positive psychology. One that frequently people talk about in the setting of cancer care is kind of the 3 good things. Have you guys heard about 3 good things? Oh, I'm so shocked. You're getting the athletes in the evening?"

So I really appreciate the opportunity to connect with her. I also really learned, and we'll talk with Skip about this. We can give mucitis and full sores, and this relates to nutrition today about what do we eat? You know, it's very painful. So after chemotherapy, your mouth is kind of sore, got cold sores. So I discovered that similum dental paste, very effective for me, very focal cold sores. So I tried that yesterday, it was probably my self inflamed and throbbing, and I felt much better later.

So we have 2 different time periods. So first, we have nutrition for cancer prevention. Okay? And this is what people typically think about when they're thinking about nutrition. You know, fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, winning alcohol, winning animal products, all that kind of stuff. But then we have nutrition for cancer treatment.

Identify the sources of nutrition support. We're not going to go too much into that, but just so you know. Understand the importance of nutrition pre and post surgery.

So four main goals of nutrition during treatment. Okay? So, again, if you're able to eat fruits and vegetables and all great stuff on top of this, fine. But this is what I really care about. The first one being weight maintenance. Okay?

If you're actively losing weight, you're not gonna be able to do that. Okay? So first thing, weightiness. The second one, we wanna protect your muscle. Okay? When we have cancer, we have very high protein. So you have all the normal protein. Then on top of that, you have all the cancer cell death, all the healthy cell growth, and all of that requires protein. And when we're not eating enough, it's gonna pull it from our muscles, and then we're gonna be feeling really weak. And so it turns to this vicious circle. Okay? So we really wanna be getting enough protein when we're going through cancer treatment. Okay? And then hydration."

And then manage symptoms. I really think of symptom management as like whack a mole. If we can keep things down, pop them down as soon as they come come up, then it's okay. We can avoid that snowball effect. But if things pop up and they stay up, then they turn into bigger problems. So a little bit of nausea is okay if you can control it. But if it turns into vomiting, then it turns into dehydration, the problems just get bigger and bigger and bigger. Okay? So we wanna keep those down. So, again, this is what I care about. You're not losing weight. You're getting good protein. You're, uh, hydrated, and you're keeping your symptoms down. K? So potential nutritional side effects. So most people, I rarely see increases in appetite. It usually decreases, although it can happen. Um, changes in taste."

A lot of people get diagnosed and come in with a weight loss. That's one of, you know, a common thing is that people will have unexplained weight loss, and that's how they get diagnosed with cancer. So maybe they lost \u00a320 just in the diagnosis part. Then they find out that they have cancer, so they need to they think they need to have the healthiest diet in the world. And so they cut out everything, quote, unquote, bad, and then they lose another \u00a320. And now they come to me, and they're about to start treatment, and they're down \u00a340. They're already, you know, behind the 8 ball. So really important to know that wanna avoid that, mitigate. Some people are overweight, so maybe we don't necessarily need to gain. Just hold on to where we are, but it's case by case. Again, malnutrition, really wanna avoid malnutrition when we're going through treatment. It can be life threatening if you can't maintain your weight. We do get people who go extremely underweight, require nutrition support."

This is something that not just nutrition, but the entire team is looking at. Alright. You guys know this. I'm not telling you anything you don't. Nutrition support tube feeding. This is when we feed into the stomach. The key with this, we say this all the time, if the gut works, use it. We always wanna use the least invasive way to support someone nutritionally.

It's typically if you're average, you know, person, we're gonna be able to do one of the other escalations. So really, we wanna avoid TPN if we can. Okay. So nutrition before surgery. So, um, we wanna get ahead of people. So when they go into surgery, they're in as good as condition as possible for the surgery. So we care about a couple of things. The first one, I want to make sure that they're getting enough protein.

So important to make sure that we're coming into surgery, well hydrated, good protein, and having a bowel movement every day. Okay? Again, um, some of these things, it enhances the immune response. It reduces risk of infections or complications. Okay. After surgery, again, um, we have increased calorie and protein needs for wound healing and recovery.

So nausea daily, the 1st week after treatment. Random nausea, 2 to 3, um, times a week in the after week. We'll take Zofran and Compazine 2 to 3 times a day, which is a good amount of Zofran and Compazine. Again, those things are very constipating. So, ideally, when we fix problems, when we put that mold down, we're not having one pop up over here. So if we're putting the nausea down, but we're getting the constipation over here, not an ideal solution. Again, if you need to take the medication, take the medication. But some of the best nausea interventions actually have nothing to do with the medications, so we'll talk about that. Okay. Which is helpful. Also, sipping water, ginger ale, lozenges.

So, um, a a full court press of nausea, eating for nausea, is eating within 20 minutes of waking, eating every hour throughout the day, even if it's just a bite or chew of food. Staying on that consistent schedule is a lot better than having those long breaks. All the way up to bedtime, having a bedtime snack, and then keeping a snack on your bedside table. A lot of people get nauseous in the morning because they don't, uh, because they go all night without eating. So just a bite or two overnight can really save you in the morning from getting nauseous.

Trying to make each individual bite of food have as many calories as possible because you don't know. You may only get 1 or 2 bites of food before you're done and wanna stop. Now early satiety wasn't an issue for doctor Lin, but it is for a lot of patients. That's why they get really full from really small amounts of food. K? So the easiest way to do that is with fat. Fat has twice the amount of calories as either protein or carbs, um, and it's small. So butter, cream, cheese, oil, nut butter, avocado, whatever fats you like. We're always adding toppings and extra sides to our foods. We never eat things plain. K? So that's the second strategy for eating, um, is to eat densely. And then the third strategy is concentrated drinks. So a concentrated drink is any drink that has fat and protein in it. So that could be a milkshake."
