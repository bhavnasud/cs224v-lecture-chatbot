Chronic cough can have a lot of variety of causes, both respiratory tract causes both, the respiratory tract remember goes from your sinus area all the way down to your lungs. So anything going on in your sinuses, you know, sinus infections, allergies can cause a chronic cough. Also, your GI systems cause a chronic cough, so heartburn, when you get acid from your stomach, can go up into your esophagus and cause, tickle your cough receptors in the back of your throat and cause a chronic cough. It's actually a very common cause of cough, especially in people who teach a lot, because you're projecting your voice and it causes you to compress your stomach and that pushes acid up in your stomach. And bringing too much Diet Coke. And getting too much Diet Coke. So those kind of the three things you think of. And then also the next thing is the nature of the cough. What is a cough like?

And just not to give his whole history, but he had COVID a couple years ago, twice in the fall, October 23 October 22, so it wasn't like a post COVID cough. So anyway, so I decided doing a lung exam, and you know his cough, his lung exam was unusual, because he had some very high pitched wheezing sound in his upper airway fields, which were kind of unusual.

So you don't wanna x-ray everyone because there's a lot of radiation and a lot of useless x rays. So we finally did an x-ray on Bryant, I think on May 3rd or May 4th. Okay, let me bring up the x-ray. And Doctor. Klooey, since you're here, you know, how many of your patients with lung cancer present with cough, with a long standing, like with a, with a cough? Yeah, how many, how many of your patients actually say, Hey, it all started when I had this cough? So very few of the patients that I take care of actually have any symptoms at all, as I'll get into.

But mainly what we're seeing here is we're seeing these are the lung fields, so this is the left lung, right lung. This is the heart border, so you can see the heart magnified against the chest wall. These are the bronchi, so this is the left main bronchi and the right brain bronchi, and that's the trachea. And then these are the diaphragms. So when you look at the x-ray, you just want to look overall, um, what are the lung fields look like. You want to see if the heart is midline, um, is the heart silhouette normal size. You want to look at the corners here, the costophrenic corners, to see if there's any fluid. In this case, you know, this, if you look on the left side, this this is really sharp.

Then the other characteristic things of this x-ray are, you look at the heart border. And in this side case, the right heart border should be a smooth line going up through here. In this case, there was all this haziness. So this tells you there's something going on between the heart and the chest wall, which is the lung. There's something going on in the right side of the lung. And you see a lot of what we call infiltrates.

And so there's lymph nodes there that are enlarged and causing the, um, the heart to be a little bit wider than normal. And then if you look at the the bronchi, they're a little bit you know, your bronchi kinda more like this. They're a little bit more, you know, pushed out a little bit. So you wonder if there's lymph nodes there that kind of pressing the bronchi up a little bit. So it was not a normal X-ray. And, you know, we would probably just call this maybe right middle lobe pneumonia, perhaps, but it was very concerning with the shape of the mediastinum. And then on the lateral view, you can actually see some more details, and there's some details on the lateral view that suggested there was fluid around the bronchi on the right side.

What you know, as an internist, we're not radiologists and we're not surgeons. So, you know, I always cheat. Back in the day, we called it the orange crayon sign.

Um, I also run our lung cancer screening clinic and, um, one of the associate medical directors of the Stanford Cancer Center. So I'll talk a little bit of the background about lung cancer staging and screening. So lung cancer causes more deaths than any other cancer. If you look at the causes of death overall, cancer is about a 5th, and lung cancer is about a 5th of cancer deaths. So it's not the most common. The most common by far is breast cancer in women and prostate cancer in men, but lung cancer is a lot more deadly. So it is the most common cause of cancer death in both men and women. In the United States this year, they estimate about 125,000 people will die from lung cancer. And Doctor. Lin has mentioned staging.", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-09-25"}
{"document_title": "Lectures", "full_section_title": "Lectures > Lecture 1 (Diagnosis and Screening)", "content": "So anytime we diagnose cancer, any type of cancer, one of the first steps is called staging, and it's a way that physicians will classify, um, the cancer based on how big the tumor is or where it has spread. So the stages always go from 1 through 4, um, 1 being the earliest and then 4 essentially being metastatic. Um, and here's my diagrams of lung cancer stages. So on the left for 1, it's when the tumor is quite small and it hasn't spread anywhere. Um, in stage 2, it's spread to lymph nodes that are really close by. So you can see this lymph node's right next to the tumor. In stage 3, it is spread to lymph nodes that are a little further away. So these are in the mediastinum, which is the middle of the chest here. And then in stage 4, it's spread to other organs. So that could be the other lung. It could be the brain or bone or some of the more common areas. And so one of the reasons why lung cancer is so deadly is that it doesn't cause symptoms until it's quite advanced most of the time. So people can be in stage 1 and have a small tumor, and they have plenty of normal lung, and they feel completely normal. And even in stage 2 and sometimes 3, people might even feel totally normal, as Doctor. Lin did for quite a while.", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-09-25"}

So it can obstruct an airway or push on an airway and cause a cough. It can grow into a blood vessel, and people can start coughing up blood. Um, if it spreads to the brain, people might have headaches. If it spreads to the spine, for example, someone might have back pain. And as was discussed, these symptoms are actually quite common. So someone who goes to their primary care physician and says, I have a cough, it could be a 1,000,000 different things that are not lung cancer. Same with back pain. Right?

{"document_title": "Lectures", "full_section_title": "Lectures > Lecture 1 (Diagnosis and Screening)", "content": "And one of the reasons why it's so important to diagnose people early is that the prognosis just plummets as you go down the stages. So if you have a very early stage 1, and there are actually many subcategories of stages, so there's even stage 1A and B and 1A1, and, uh, it's very subclassified. But the very earliest stage, over 90% of people will be alive 5 years later, whereas that basically plummets. And in stage 4, it's less than 10% of people. Most people are diagnosed on this side because that's when they have symptoms and actually go to get evaluated by their primary care physician. So we have really tried to figure out how can we diagnose people on the early side before they have any symptoms, and that is called cancer screening or screening in general. So screening in general means that you're looking for a disease, in this case lung cancer, before it causes any symptoms. And so you are essentially performing a test on a healthy person. And so probably you've heard of more common screening tests like mammography for breast cancer or colonoscopies for colon cancer.

It takes just really a few seconds to do the actual scan. Um, there's no pain, no IVs, no needles performed. They are basically asked just to take a deep breath and hold it for a few seconds so that nothing's moving as the, um, as they're scanning.

Um, just because I know some of you are not yet in medicine, um, so I just wanted to explain what a pack year was. This is how physicians can quantify the smoking history for each person. So we multiply the number of packs smoked per day on average by the number of years smoked. So the criteria for screening currently is 20 pack years. So you can actually arrive at 20 pack years with different types of smoking history. If someone smoked 1 pack per day for 20 years, they have 20 pack years. If someone smoked 2 packs per day for 10 years, that's also 20 pack years.", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-09-25"}

And this was, um, a multicenter trial run by the National Cancer Institute, and they enrolled over 50,000 people. You can see they were even heavier smokers. That was the original screening guidelines. And the, um, the participants were randomized to 3 annual screenings, either with the low dose CT scan or with just a plain chest X-ray. Um, and some of the key findings are here. Um, they detected lung cancer in 1.1% of people after the first scan, and half of those were in stage 1. So that's when we can cure people. And overall, after the 3 screenings, the lung cancer mortality decreased by 20%. So for every 320 low dose CT scans, they, um, calculated that we would prevent 1 lung cancer death.

So that's the I think, reporting and data system. Um, and so every lung nodule will be classified in one of these from 0 to 4 x depending on how suspicious it is. And you can see the estimated prevalence in the population, and then management depends on how suspicious things are. So if the lung nodule is likely benign, then we may just say get your usual annual LDCT in 1 year. If it's probably benign, we might say, come back earlier. Let's do it in 6 months because we don't want to let this grow if it is a cancer.

Is that for the general population or those that have smoked 20 back years? Those that have smoked. Yeah. So lung cancer screening implementation has been really slow. The National Lung Screening Trial was published in 2011, and the US Preventive Services Task Force officially recommended lung cancer screening in 2013, so 2 years later. And then Medicare covered lung cancer screening starting in 2015. So it took several years just to get this covered by insurance. And even now, almost a decade later, you can see that the screening rates are extremely low. So in California, we are this dark blue.

Radiation exposure, false positives, meaning finding a lung nodule that's initially suspicious and might lead to other, um, scans or tests or biopsies or procedures, even surgery, and then end up being benign. Overdiagnosis. So I think that's more rare in lung cancer, but it's possible that we find a nodule that is very slowly growing. So it wouldn't have hurt the person anyway, but because we found it, we treated it. Incidental findings, so other findings that lead to, um, tests that end up being benign potentially. The cost of the scan, both to the person and then us as a health care system. And then overriding, I think, all of this is anxiety of fear of the scan, fear of lung cancer, fear of knowing that you have lung nodules, even if your doctor tells you they're probably benign.

Um, so we know that Asian people are more likely to get a type of lung cancer called adenocarcinoma. They're more likely to have eGFR mutations, as Doctor. Lin has. They're more likely to be never smokers. So, um, in the US, about 20% of people diagnosed with lung cancer never smoked. But in Asian populations and Asian American populations, that could be really up to 80% in some racial and ethnic groups. And then finally, they could be round glass modules as well. So this is one small study that shows a little bit of the trends. This was a study out of Florida. So the numbers are small, but I think the trends are very clear.

And some of the things, you know, might make sense in terms of Asian culture, but it's very hard to parse out all of these really, um, personal details and risk factors that people have. So, um, it's probably multifactorial. We know that genetics must play some role in it. We know that people with a family history of lung cancer are more likely to have lung cancer, but there's no gene to test now. Secondhand smoke may be a factor.

I'll skip this. It's a little into the weeds.

So Taiwan, um, well, I back up and say a lot of places in Asia are now offering screening. I think their health care system's very different, um, and they're much more likely to recommend scans. So I've had several patients who go to Asia to, um, uh, see their family or go back home and they go see a doctor.

So it's a little interesting the imaging sort of the time from imaging to diagnosis would order the time of seeing a specialist because frequently the specialist won't order imaging right away. So that was 72 days. But in my experience, in my case, I didn't put that on there because I sort of saw the specialist as I went along and sort of had to be involved there during there. So the right 42 versus 289, 7 days versus 43, right? And like the ideal case, right? I mean, other than maybe the 6 weeks, you could argue that 5 to 6 weeks, you could have gotten short.

Yeah, that's a really great observation. Yeah, we were talking about the first barrier being maybe cost and insurance coverage and how some countries have successfully implemented universal health care, but how with that also comes potentially longer wait times of distribution of resources is difficult in that sense too.

So a lot of what you'll hear me focus on is how do we build the right systems and people so that when key barriers are coming up, we have some ability to help patients, whoever they are, kind of navigate through it. Um, so the connection piece, um, the location piece, so the example you were giving, I just can't emphasize enough that, um, the lens of geography of if you're in an urban setting versus a rural setting.

It's almost what we call the Kaiser plans where they're all managed medical at the county level. So it allows a bit of coordination to help address many of these issues for patients particularly that have Medicaid. But one of the elements that comes from a lot of that is we have one of our counties that had a single neurologist for their county health plan. That neurologist retired last year, and they've been unable to recruit another neurologist. So they've essentially lost. So I'm putting up here one thing that wasn't mentioned was workforce, like actual people. So when we go through each of these different elements, the 5 A's, you've kind of intersected these into here. So affordability, there's the affordability side that many of you are focused on and Brian shared this.

So it's solving one set of problems, but it's creating a different set of problems. So the affordability, just to have us think of there's 2 sides to the affordability and true for health systems as well of how they manage the basics of where the dollars come from, how they use them, how the resources get together. And the accessibility, a number of you touched on, some of that is about accessibility, about location and geography, but even around availability, one of the things we did a lot in the pandemic is, so at Stanford prior to, and Brian knows as well, prior to the pandemic, hadn't arrived here yet, but prior to the pandemic, uh, take a guess at what percentage of kind of clinic visits were done through now what we call video visits.", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-10-09"}

Doesn't mean that there isn't a role for a morning person, but it's actually helped us with a lot of the access issues. Whereas someone who's coming in with an urgent care issue that's gonna need diagnostics, we wanna make sure we've access for those patients to come in person.

So again, from the state of California, the biggest levers they have are where you have the 5 medical schools that are state oriented, which are the 5 University of California systems. And having come from one of them, that was a lot of what allowed some of the growth of different programs, both from a school of nursing, school of dentistry, school of pharmacy, school of medicine, advanced practice areas, and others. So the state schools are very tied to the strategy of the state level because the resources obviously help support them in both directions. The other question you might ask is if you look at graduates of medical schools from the US, are we matching the supply and demand of what's needed?", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-10-09"}

So that's a different, that's not about who we're bringing into medical school, that's one of the way we're creating and matching people into where the needs are. So the other very good example you gave is, again, I'll use the UC system. They opened a brand new medical school in Merced recently. And part of why they did that was for the very reason your question's getting at is they recognized a big gap in physicians in a community that needs them. Let's put a medical school there. Let's try to recruit people from the community who want to be trained and that want to work in that community. So there's a lot of that happening in multiple parts of the country.

The example I'll give you, I'll go back to India, because I learned about this group when I was interned here and through colleagues, is during the pandemic, they actually, an ambulance company there redeployed all their ambulances actually to provide access in rural areas, not to bring people back to where this town was, but actually to take care kind of out.

Absolutely. And that touches on access to primary care. If you have a good relationship with your primary care doctor, perhaps you don't call, or if you have easy access or somebody answers the phone, like we have a clinical advice service 24 hours, 20 fourseven at Stanford, and they didn't have that when I started at Stanford.

It's based out in Newark. I've gone there several times and usually what I do when I go there is I spend about an hour and a half and I just listen in on phone calls with the team that's doing it. It's, how have you ever been out to New York? It's amazing. They sit there with 3 screens and I've listened, they're organized in 3 areas of the types of phone calls. If they're like really generic, basic, how do I get a primary care doctor?

And when you look at the prevalence of cancer, while many diseases fortunately are getting much better treatments, people are surviving, living longer with it, but also getting a massive continued growth of number of cases. So when Stanford Medicine, one of the large initiatives over the next 5 10 years is actually really doubling down on cancer care in particular, including the idea and design and vision to build a cancer kind of specific campus, partly because cancer, as Brian's helping teach you, has gotten me so complex in the diagnostics, the therapeutics, the specialization.

Maybe the therapy would start while they were still in the hospital, be a 3 week hospitalization. So much of cancer care now, I've watched this in my own practice the last 25 years in the hospital, things we used to take care of in the hospital almost rarely see the hospital.

So we've set up a diagnostic clinic specifically for patients who don't yet have a diagnosis but a high suspicion for. And it allows that centralized clinic to basically help shepherd patients through the process. What we haven't solved for are some of the other elements that all of you brought up. Some of the social drivers of health, some of the insurance access that again, the country we live in and the state we live in, where you are insured has a huge impact on your health outcomes. Believe me, from a policy perspective, I wish that was not the case, but that is the case.

And they they they're the ones who every 5 years do these reports. So we are actually working on updating this cancer. So hopefully soon we'll have more contemporary statistics, because cancer prevalence and all has changed, but cancer caregiving and cancer survivorship has changed a lot too in the last 10 years. More and more people are talking of self management in cancer in a way that we've talked historically historically in other chronic conditions like diabetes and heart disease, but there's been much more recent phenomena in cancer and more and more people are thinking of the chronic care model. So what does it mean by self management? Self management is literally everything that the health care team tells the patient to do when they leave the clinic. Right? So take your you know, make sure you get your vaccinations, make sure your father's diet, go and get your 10,000 steps, whatever it might be, right? These are the medicines, make sure you take them, whatever, all that is considered self management.", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-10-16"}

So in a chronic, in the broader chronic illness literature, what we know is that when people have somebody to provide them support, whether it's a family caregiver or just a support structure, they're better at their way to self management recommendations, right? And so family caregivers are really important in making sure that things outside of the clinic are taken care of. In serious illnesses like cancer, you also have things, you might have wound care, you might have other biologics that need to be given, because so much of cancer care is more and more moving to outpatient care rather than inpatient care at least in the US. So family caregivers are on the hook for all of that stuff. And yet we do not empower caregivers to navigate and, you know, we're gonna hear about people with who have the embodied knowledge of being cancer caregivers and they'll be able to speak to this also. Uh, but caregivers are kind of still left at a distance. They're still not engaged explicitly and systematically by the health care system and it's something that you all are gonna teach.

They don't, not to mention, they might have jobs at other caregivers, including kids and older folks and all kinds of other things going on. They don't have time to come in and with and be engaged with the health care system. There's interpersonal issues. So not everybody gets along, and so there might be some interpersonal barriers to engaging caregivers. Either the caregiver and the health care system are not interacting effectively or within the patient caregiver diet, there's some tension and so it's playing out. There's policy issues. Right now, we don't have in the fee for service model really good policies that support reimbursement of, uh, indicating caregiver. There are reimbursement posts.

You know, you don't have time. You're not being given time to actually be thoughtfully engaging caregivers. And then there's cultural issues and this is where I'm going to talk a little bit more about. So there's cultural like language barrier being the most obvious thing that people that might come to mind. But there's cultural practices like who's in charge? The typical way that we think about, uh, in the US is like if you have a patient, the partner is the default family caregivers, but that may not be true in different cultures. Um, it may be another woman, especially if the patient was a woman. So those things need to be understood so that we can culturally provide culturally to care to our patients. Um, there's gender differences. So there's a lot of cultures in which I mean, basically all cultures women are the de facto caregiver. But to give you an example, there's, um, in the US, about 2 thirds of caregivers are women. In India, 81% are women. And what they provide care also is different in who provides care.

The motivation is culturally embedded, so there might be more a sense of duty for in some cultures versus affection or love that might be driving the caregiver responsibilities. Intergenerational care is also culturally embedded if you think of the cultures that you live in, like who's providing care of. If you just think about right now, who's providing care to somebody older in your family, somebody sick in your family or friends even. And you'll sort of see how this is playing out in just in your milieu. Among LGBTQ plus groups, for example, there's a lot more peer care than intergenerational care because they often are estranged from their families of origin and often then do not have kids. And so there's a lot more peer support that happens in among the LGBTQ plus communities. And then different cultures have a different takeovers, individualist culture versus collectivist cultures that matters too.

Cancer is just cancer, so it's almost like people you know, this is a weird dog even gonna come up with a word for that. And for survivor, American Cancer Society actually has Hindi language materials, which is good, but it's like super high caliber, like you know it's just like the health records is very high.

So if we just do patient focused work, then we're certainly missing the caregiver, but if we just do caregiver focused work, we're actually missing the role, the patient, and their relationship plays.

At least I'll just So, uh, my daughter, 31 years old, was diagnosed in January with a very rare and aggressive cancer called nut carcinoma. There's really no treatment for it. If you went to a hospital outside of maybe the top 5 or 6 hospitals in the country, it's likely that you wouldn't be correctly diagnosed. So I'm grateful to Bryant and the people here at Stanford. Uh, my daughter has had a, uh, very, very challenging, uh, treatment plan. She had a 14 hour endoscopic, uh, surgery, removed a tumor, but also they needed to remove her left eye. She had 6 weeks of daily radiation. She's had multiple rounds of different types of chemotherapy. She was extremely nauseous, uh, required frequent hospitalizations.

Um, and she's currently in a in a clinical trial now as there's really no, there's very, very little expertise around this particular type of cancer. So I have to say that there are times in this discussion of caregiving, it is a business, there are people that are looking at it in statistical terms and lost dollars and what it means. I can honestly say I never thought of myself and still don't think of myself as a caregiver. I'm the father of a daughter who's very sick and requires a lot of care. Um, it's not that hard for me. It's much harder for her. Um, and care, really, you know, I thought to myself, I would at least share a framework since you won't be treating statistics, you will be treating individuals. So the care of a 6 year old is a little different than the care of a 14 year old, a 30 year old, 50, 60, 70, 90. The conversations that an 80 year old doctor can have with a 94 year old person is pretty different than the kind of conversation you wanna have with a 31 year old person.", "block_type": "text", "language": "en", "last_edit_date": "2024-10-16"}

It's very difficult for one person to provide all the care that you need. What kind of care does this person really need? And not everybody needs the same care. There are certain things in my family that I can do better than everybody else. There are many things that I can't do. And so the point was made earlier about having a large support group. And I think that's true. And I think if you are a caring person, it becomes just an easier way to think about that. Like, what does this person really need? How will you interact with them? It? And so for me, what is it, what is caring? What does it mean to be a caregiver? What do you actually do? I think of it in 2 broad buckets. One is you are reacting to facts and things that happen that you hadn't anticipated. And that just as a result of not being able to anticipate it, you just have to react to whatever the need happens to be. The care that my daughter needed when a tumor was on her nerve and she was hospitalized and no amount of morphine could alleviate her pain, that's different than the fact that she's out now and out of the hospital.

And as you heard before, you know, uh, people call it a marathon. I think it's a sprint and a marathon, and then there are times when there's literally nothing. So it is not one thing. Cancer is not one thing. The other thing that I think caregiving or caring doesn't have to be for a person with cancer, just being caring in your relationships takes you 80% of the way down to caring for somebody that's sick. And that's anticipating what a person's needs are. I now, and our family knows what things could change, and then we'll react to the circumstances. But we spend a lot of time planning and anticipating and having contingency plans and and so on and what happens. So, you know, for me, um, living in in the world that I call of of cancer stand, which is living with cancer, I wouldn't expect I certainly didn't have any appreciation for what that world is like until you're in it.

But I think of myself more just as a loving, caring parent. And we have, you know, a family that is trying to do everything we can, and we're not always successful, uh, at it. But I think if you spend all of your time thinking about the person and what they need, they may communicate exactly what they need, and then they may not communicate what they need. Or they may tell you something that you don't think they need. So I think the, from my, you know, I wouldn't begin to be able to advise anybody else how to care for the people that they love, other than how do you care for them generally and how do you show people that you love them. And then it becomes a little less burdensome and a little less, um, terrible, really. But, um, I guess that's my 2¢. I'll pass it to her. Why don't we open it up to questions? I know we only have a couple minutes left, but what we can do is I think we still have the room afterwards. Yeah. So if folks need to head out for other classes, welcome to.

Maybe I'll start with a question is, um, for Skip. So, you know, as a loving parent and as being a parent, although my kids were younger, our kids were younger, it can be very stressful to be a parent in many, at all ages, in any situations. So how did you manage that aspect of this, you know, for you personally as a father? Good question. And I think it kind of, I know your relationship with your kids doesn't start at age 30 or 50 or whatever it is. So you bring a relationship already to the table. And what cancer does is it just, for me, it sort of made it more so. So it becomes very exaggerated. And kids were scared and fearful. They didn't know the answer. And I feel fortunate that, you know, um, our kids are older, so they are adults, and we have, over our lives together, tried work and have worked very hard to have loving adult conversations.

I think we try to be as gracious in understanding with each other. Sometimes I've had times when my daughter did not wanna continue with her treatment where she was in too much pain. I had one daughter who could not focus on her job and needed to take some time off. I could do all the parenting that I wanted to do, and I would parent them differently if they were 8 and needed to go to school, I could force them to do things. But if you're forcing 31 year old kids to do something, it's not a card that I really wanna use very often. So I respect them. We built a relationship over the years, and I think we were fortunate. They they gave me the benefit of the doubt when I was not at my best, and I try to give them the benefit of the doubt when they're not at their best. And the one thing that I know is how I told my daughter three things. You will never be alone. You will have the best care that we can imagine.
