So anything going on in your sinuses, you know, sinus infections, allergies can cause a chronic cough. Also, your GI systems cause a chronic cough, so heartburn, when you get acid from your stomach, can go up into your esophagus and cause, tickle your cough receptors in the back of your throat and cause a chronic cough. It's actually a very common cause of cough, especially in people who teach a lot, because you're projecting your voice and it causes you to compress your stomach and that pushes acid up in your stomach. And bringing too much Diet Coke. And getting too much Diet Coke. So those kind of the three things you think of. And then also the next thing is the nature of the cough. What is a cough like?

And just not to give his whole history, but he had COVID a couple years ago, twice in the fall, October 23 October 22, so it wasn't like a post COVID cough.

There's something going on in the right side of the lung. And you see a lot of what we call infiltrates.

Um, Natalie Louie, I'm one of the thoracic surgeons at Stanford. Um, I also run our lung cancer screening clinic and, um, one of the associate medical directors of the Stanford Cancer Center. So I'll talk a little bit of the background about lung cancer staging and screening. So lung cancer causes more deaths than any other cancer. If you look at the causes of death overall, cancer is about a 5th, and lung cancer is about a 5th of cancer deaths. So it's not the most common. The most common by far is breast cancer in women and prostate cancer in men, but lung cancer is a lot more deadly. So it is the most common cause of cancer death in both men and women.

{"document_title": "Lectures", "section_title": "Lectures > Lecture 1", "content": "So anytime we diagnose cancer, any type of cancer, one of the first steps is called staging, and it's a way that physicians will classify, um, the cancer based on how big the tumor is or where it has spread. So the stages always go from 1 through 4, um, 1 being the earliest and then 4 essentially being metastatic. Um, and here's my diagrams of lung cancer stages. So on the left for 1, it's when the tumor is quite small and it hasn't spread anywhere. Um, in stage 2, it's spread to lymph nodes that are really close by. So you can see this lymph node's right next to the tumor. In stage 3, it is spread to lymph nodes that are a little further away. So these are in the mediastinum, which is the middle of the chest here. And then in stage 4, it's spread to other organs. So that could be the other lung. It could be the brain or bone or some of the more common areas. And so one of the reasons why lung cancer is so deadly is that it doesn't cause symptoms until it's quite advanced most of the time. So people can be in stage 1 and have a small tumor, and they have plenty of normal lung, and they feel completely normal. And even in stage 2 and sometimes 3, people might even feel totally normal, as Doctor.

So it can obstruct an airway or push on an airway and cause a cough. It can grow into a blood vessel, and people can start coughing up blood. Um, if it spreads to the brain, people might have headaches. If it spreads to the spine, for example, someone might have back pain. And as was discussed, these symptoms are actually quite common. So someone who goes to their primary care physician and says, I have a cough, it could be a 1,000,000 different things that are not lung cancer. Same with back pain. Right?

So if you have a very early stage 1, and there are actually many subcategories of stages, so there's even stage 1A and B and 1A1, and, uh, it's very subclassified. But the very earliest stage, over 90% of people will be alive 5 years later, whereas that basically plummets. And in stage 4, it's less than 10% of people. Most people are diagnosed on this side because that's when they have symptoms and actually go to get evaluated by their primary care physician. So we have really tried to figure out how can we diagnose people on the early side before they have any symptoms, and that is called cancer screening or screening in general. So screening in general means that you're looking for a disease, in this case lung cancer, before it causes any symptoms. And so you are essentially performing a test on a healthy person.

They are basically asked just to take a deep breath and hold it for a few seconds so that nothing's moving as the, um, as they're scanning.

Um, just because I know some of you are not yet in medicine, um, so I just wanted to explain what a pack year was. This is how physicians can quantify the smoking history for each person. So we multiply the number of packs smoked per day on average by the number of years smoked. So the criteria for screening currently is 20 pack years. So you can actually arrive at 20 pack years with different types of smoking history. If someone smoked 1 pack per day for 20 years, they have 20 pack years.

And this was, um, a multicenter trial run by the National Cancer Institute, and they enrolled over 50,000 people. You can see they were even heavier smokers. That was the original screening guidelines. And the, um, the participants were randomized to 3 annual screenings, either with the low dose CT scan or with just a plain chest X-ray. Um, and some of the key findings are here. Um, they detected lung cancer in 1.1% of people after the first scan, and half of those were in stage 1. So that's when we can cure people. And overall, after the 3 screenings, the lung cancer mortality decreased by 20%. So for every 320 low dose CT scans, they, um, calculated that we would prevent 1 lung cancer death.

So that's the I think, reporting and data system. Um, and so every lung nodule will be classified in one of these from 0 to 4 x depending on how suspicious it is. And you can see the estimated prevalence in the population, and then management depends on how suspicious things are. So if the lung nodule is likely benign, then we may just say get your usual annual LDCT in 1 year. If it's probably benign, we might say, come back earlier. Let's do it in 6 months because we don't want to let this grow if it is a cancer.

Is that for the general population or those that have smoked 20 back years? Those that have smoked. Yeah. So lung cancer screening implementation has been really slow. The National Lung Screening Trial was published in 2011, and the US Preventive Services Task Force officially recommended lung cancer screening in 2013, so 2 years later. And then Medicare covered lung cancer screening starting in 2015. So it took several years just to get this covered by insurance.

So one might ask, well, why not just screen everybody and then we'll find all lung cancers and no one will ever be diagnosed with advanced lung cancer. Um, but there are risks to the screening test. Radiation exposure, false positives, meaning finding a lung nodule that's initially suspicious and might lead to other, um, scans or tests or biopsies or procedures, even surgery, and then end up being benign. Overdiagnosis. So I think that's more rare in lung cancer, but it's possible that we find a nodule that is very slowly growing. So it wouldn't have hurt the person anyway, but because we found it, we treated it. Incidental findings, so other findings that lead to, um, tests that end up being benign potentially. The cost of the scan, both to the person and then us as a health care system. And then overriding, I think, all of this is anxiety of fear of the scan, fear of lung cancer, fear of knowing that you have lung nodules, even if your doctor tells you they're probably benign. That can cause a lot of anxiety. Doctor. Lin, I don't know if you want me to go into this. I know it's close to the end. So if you want No. No. No. Please.

So we are understanding over the last many years, um, that lung cancer in Asian people is different. And so that's one reason why CARE, the Center For Asian Health Research and Education, wanted to focus on lung cancer and never smokers. Um, so we know that Asian people are more likely to get a type of lung cancer called adenocarcinoma. They're more likely to have eGFR mutations, as Doctor. Lin has. They're more likely to be never smokers. So, um, in the US, about 20% of people diagnosed with lung cancer never smoked. But in Asian populations and Asian American populations, that could be really up to 80% in some racial and ethnic groups. And then finally, they could be round glass modules as well. So this is one small study that shows a little bit of the trends. This was a study out of Florida. So the numbers are small, but I think the trends are very clear. You can see that the, um, these are people, um, diagnosed with lung cancer and then the proportion or the percentage of never smokers in that group.", "last_edit_date": "2024-09-25", "url": "https://mediasite.stanford.edu/Mediasite/Play/069f043e54e84dadb2d0637e6b6df1cd1d", "block_metadata": {"block_type": "text", "language": "en", "time_range_minutes": "43-45", "speakers": ["Bryant Lin (MD)", "Natalie Liu (MD)"], "lecture_title": "Diagnosis and Screening"}}

And this is also, uh, reflected in the men as well in gray, but not to such a big extent. So a lot of people have been, um, trying to figure out why there's this big difference. And some of the things, you know, might make sense in terms of Asian culture, but it's very hard to parse out all of these really, um, personal details and risk factors that people have. So, um, it's probably multifactorial. We know that genetics must play some role in it. We know that people with a family history of lung cancer are more likely to have lung cancer, but there's no gene to test now. Secondhand smoke may be a factor.

I'll skip this. It's a little into the weeds. And then I just wanted to give you an example of the ground glass nodules or part solid nodules that we see, um, quite frequently in never smokers who have lung cancer. And they'll often be a little wisp here you can see where it's, um, really not very dense and very similar to the lung parenchyma. And we know that people with these, they often grow very slowly.

We do have to balance the risks and benefits of the scans, and knowing that many patients have a slower growing cancer may affect how frequently we recommend screening. So Taiwan, um, well, I back up and say a lot of places in Asia are now offering screening. I think their health care system's very different, um, and they're much more likely to recommend scans. So I've had several patients who go to Asia to, um, uh, see their family or go back home and they go see a doctor.

Um, we started talking about, like, um, the different, like, factors to getting health care access, and we eventually, like, came to the conclusion that all the factors were, like, compounding. So if you have one risk factor, you're at a higher risk for other risk factors in terms of getting health care access. And so that was kind of like where we ended. Yeah, that's a really great observation. Yeah, we were talking about the first barrier being maybe cost and insurance coverage and how some countries have successfully implemented universal health care, but how with that also comes potentially longer wait times of distribution of resources is difficult in that sense too.

So I'm giving you one framework is actually your exercise with Brian actually touched on a bunch of them. So this actually goes back and someone will correct me if they actually Google it. I believe this goes back to a framework back in like the 1980s.

So a lot of what you'll hear me focus on is how do we build the right systems and people so that when key barriers are coming up, we have some ability to help patients, whoever they are, kind of navigate through it.

It's almost what we call the Kaiser plans where they're all managed medical at the county level. So it allows a bit of coordination to help address many of these issues for patients particularly that have Medicaid. But one of the elements that comes from a lot of that is we have one of our counties that had a single neurologist for their county health plan. That neurologist retired last year, and they've been unable to recruit another neurologist. So they've essentially lost. So I'm putting up here one thing that wasn't mentioned was workforce, like actual people.

So it's solving one set of problems, but it's creating a different set of problems. So the affordability, just to have us think of there's 2 sides to the affordability and true for health systems as well of how they manage the basics of where the dollars come from, how they use them, how the resources get together.

And having come from one of them, that was a lot of what allowed some of the growth of different programs, both from a school of nursing, school of dentistry, school of pharmacy, school of medicine, advanced practice areas, and others.

Remember, it's not that old, but EMTs really started in the last 60 years or so. I mean, before you could do nothing in the ambulance, before what has evolved in terms of care. The example I'll give you, I'll go back to India, because I learned about this group when I was interned here and through colleagues, is during the pandemic, they actually, an ambulance company there redeployed all their ambulances actually to provide access in rural areas, not to bring people back to where this town was, but actually to take care kind of out.

Absolutely. And that touches on access to primary care.

It's based out in Newark. I've gone there several times and usually what I do when I go there is I spend about an hour and a half and I just listen in on phone calls with the team that's doing it.

And when you look at the prevalence of cancer, while many diseases fortunately are getting much better treatments, people are surviving, living longer with it, but also getting a massive continued growth of number of cases. So when Stanford Medicine, one of the large initiatives over the next 5 10 years is actually really doubling down on cancer care in particular, including the idea and design and vision to build a cancer kind of specific campus, partly because cancer, as Brian's helping teach you, has gotten me so complex in the diagnostics, the therapeutics, the specialization.

Maybe the therapy would start while they were still in the hospital, be a 3 week hospitalization. So much of cancer care now, I've watched this in my own practice the last 25 years in the hospital, things we used to take care of in the hospital almost rarely see the hospital.

So we've set up a diagnostic clinic specifically for patients who don't yet have a diagnosis but a high suspicion for. And it allows that centralized clinic to basically help shepherd patients through the process. What we haven't solved for are some of the other elements that all of you brought up. Some of the social drivers of health, some of the insurance access that again, the country we live in and the state we live in, where you are insured has a huge impact on your health outcomes.

Um, these are pretty dated data at this point. They, you know, as you can see, 2015. But anywhere between 3 to 6000000 people in the United States are providing care to somebody with cancer, an adult with cancer. People are providing up to 33 hours a week, so that's almost a full time job if you think about it. Right? 33 hours is a that's a full job that is 40 hours a week. And, actually, a third do provide more than 41 hours of care a week, which is a huge amount of care. And people do all kinds of different things, and I'll talk about that for a minute in a minute.

So hopefully soon we'll have more contemporary statistics, because cancer prevalence and all has changed, but cancer caregiving and cancer survivorship has changed a lot too in the last 10 years. More and more people are talking of self management in cancer in a way that we've talked historically historically in other chronic conditions like diabetes and heart disease, but there's been much more recent phenomena in cancer and more and more people are thinking of the chronic care model. So what does it mean by self management? Self management is literally everything that the health care team tells the patient to do when they leave the clinic. Right?

And so family caregivers are really important in making sure that things outside of the clinic are taken care of. In serious illnesses like cancer, you also have things, you might have wound care, you might have other biologics that need to be given, because so much of cancer care is more and more moving to outpatient care rather than inpatient care at least in the US. So family caregivers are on the hook for all of that stuff.

So not everybody gets along, and so there might be some interpersonal barriers to engaging caregivers. Either the caregiver and the health care system are not interacting effectively or within the patient caregiver diet, there's some tension and so it's playing out. There's policy issues.

So there's cultural like language barrier being the most obvious thing that people that might come to mind. But there's cultural practices like who's in charge? The typical way that we think about, uh, in the US is like if you have a patient, the partner is the default family caregivers, but that may not be true in different cultures. Um, it may be another woman, especially if the patient was a woman. So those things need to be understood so that we can culturally provide culturally to care to our patients. Um, there's gender differences. So there's a lot of cultures in which I mean, basically all cultures women are the de facto caregiver. But to give you an example, there's, um, in the US, about 2 thirds of caregivers are women. In India, 81% are women. And what they provide care also is different in who provides care.

If you just think about right now, who's providing care to somebody older in your family, somebody sick in your family or friends even. And you'll sort of see how this is playing out in just in your milieu. Among LGBTQ plus groups, for example, there's a lot more peer care than intergenerational care because they often are estranged from their families of origin and often then do not have kids. And so there's a lot more peer support that happens in among the LGBTQ plus communities. And then different cultures have a different takeovers, individualist culture versus collectivist cultures that matters too.

There are certain things in my family that I can do better than everybody else. There are many things that I can't do. And so the point was made earlier about having a large support group.

And so for me, what is it, what is caring? What does it mean to be a caregiver? What do you actually do? I think of it in 2 broad buckets. One is you are reacting to facts and things that happen that you hadn't anticipated. And that just as a result of not being able to anticipate it, you just have to react to whatever the need happens to be.

Cancer is not one thing. The other thing that I think caregiving or caring doesn't have to be for a person with cancer, just being caring in your relationships takes you 80% of the way down to caring for somebody that's sick.

When we have cancer, we have very high protein. So you have all the normal protein. Then on top of that, you have all the cancer cell death, all the healthy cell growth, and all of that requires protein. And when we're not eating enough, it's gonna pull it from our muscles, and then we're gonna be feeling really weak. And so it turns to this vicious circle. Okay?

We can avoid that snowball effect. But if things pop up and they stay up, then they turn into bigger problems. So a little bit of nausea is okay if you can control it. But if it turns into vomiting, then it turns into dehydration, the problems just get bigger and bigger and bigger. Okay? So we wanna keep those down. So, again, this is what I care about. You're not losing weight. You're getting good protein. You're, uh, hydrated, and you're keeping your symptoms down. K? So potential nutritional side effects.

That's one of, you know, a common thing is that people will have unexplained weight loss, and that's how they get diagnosed with cancer. So maybe they lost £20 just in the diagnosis part. Then they find out that they have cancer, so they need to they think they need to have the healthiest diet in the world.

When did you eat? Oh, yesterday. Well, yeah, you're gonna get nauseous. So, um, a a full court press of nausea, eating for nausea, is eating within 20 minutes of waking, eating every hour throughout the day, even if it's just a bite or chew of food. Staying on that consistent schedule is a lot better than having those long breaks. All the way up to bedtime, having a bedtime snack, and then keeping a snack on your bedside table.

Trying to make each individual bite of food have as many calories as possible because you don't know. You may only get 1 or 2 bites of food before you're done and wanna stop. Now early satiety wasn't an issue for doctor Lin, but it is for a lot of patients. That's why they get really full from really small amounts of food. K? So the easiest way to do that is with fat. Fat has twice the amount of calories as either protein or carbs, um, and it's small. So butter, cream, cheese, oil, nut butter, avocado, whatever fats you like. We're always adding toppings and extra sides to our foods. We never eat things plain. K? So that's the second strategy for eating, um, is to eat densely.

And others need support, whether it's husband, wife, father, whatever. So, yeah. It may not be something that a patient will need, but. To the extent that this, these sorts of. Tools and technologies are designed to make things easier. So so you're calculating less, but it sounds like there's nothing that. Comes to mind for you, I guess the second thing as far as. Yeah. Like, my fitness pal is women. A lot of people like Howard King is another one that people like, I just don't personally think they're that helpful. As far as the family piece of it, we very often have the wife, the daughter, whoever's cooking the food in the appointment with us. And just sometimes, you know, there's nausea and then there's there's nausea. And for a good many cancer patients, the nausea is so unmanageable and uncontrolled that the idea of eating is pretty much the last thing. That you will convince somebody that is suffering from nausea. To do, and, you know, the next step is to be in a hospital with a feeding tube. But do you have. Foods that you recommend or think about how to help those for whom compazine and Zofran is not sufficient?", "last_edit_date": "2024-11-06", "url": "https://mediasite.stanford.edu/Mediasite/Play/ca12283fe2ff4f90bccea88816ab19a91d", "block_metadata": {"block_type": "text", "language": "en", "time_range_minutes": "43-45", "speakers": ["Kate Donelan (MS, RD)", "Bryant Lin (MD)"], "lecture_title": "Nutrition During Cancer Treatment"}}
{"document_title": "Lectures", "section_title": "Lectures > Lecture 6", "content": "Yeah, nausea is a big thing. And I do think that I would say the patient that you're talking about that not eating frequently wouldn't help is very far and few between. I would say the vast majority of people that I talk to are not eating when they're nauseous. And once they start eating more regularly, even if it is a single bite of food, they take their bite of food and they come back in an hour, they take another bite of you, they feel better. So I really pushed back on the on the nausea stuff. Yeah. I I was I was skeptical, you know, because it's it's I would say, I think for patients who when you're nauseous, of course, you're like, I don't wanna eat because I feel like I'm gonna become more nauseous. Right? And it it for me, I have to say, you know, after getting kids say that, I try to eat more often, and it helped me, um, because it does it's true. Just just a little bit, not even too much.", "last_edit_date": "2024-11-06", "url": "https://mediasite.stanford.edu/Mediasite/Play/ca12283fe2ff4f90bccea88816ab19a91d", "block_metadata": {"block_type": "text", "language": "en", "time_range_minutes": "44-46", "speakers": ["Kate Donelan (MS, RD)", "Bryant Lin (MD)"], "lecture_title": "Nutrition During Cancer Treatment"}}
{"document_title": "Lectures", "section_title": "Lectures > Lecture 6", "content": "Yeah. I think that's such just like a tiny bit did help. Um, but, yeah, absolutely. There are lots of patients who are just intractable, you know, chemo induced nausea, vomiting, and that's that's very clear that some patients just need to be in a hospital for that. But but, yeah, eating, uh, a little bit really helped me personally, just that that idea that, oh, just take a Vidans. Yeah. And then just give it an hour, and then take another Vidans. Yeah. Yeah. I think that I mean, I've been at Stanford for 4 years. I've had one case like that where they just couldn't get it under control, and they were not eating. So that that was a big part of it. Um, so, yeah, I I think I think there's a lot of discussion about, like, nausea and, like, is most people have that feeling that eating is not going to make it better, but for most people, in my experience, it does.", "last_edit_date": "2024-11-06", "url": "https://mediasite.stanford.edu/Mediasite/Play/ca12283fe2ff4f90bccea88816ab19a91d", "block_metadata": {"block_type": "text", "language": "en", "time_range_minutes": "45-47", "speakers": ["Kate Donelan (MS, RD)", "Bryant Lin (MD)"], "lecture_title": "Nutrition During Cancer Treatment"}}
{"document_title": "Lectures", "section_title": "Lectures > Lecture 6", "content": "So I know you made the distinction between, like, people who are trying to, like, avoid cancer and, like, that type of diet or what what they they should be versus, like, people undergoing cancer treatment who, like, have a cancer diagnosis. And that was largely related to, like, you know, what about for, like, people with a diagnosis that's like, take 1 breast cancer or a prostate cancer where you don't have chemo, but you're still, like, undergoing, like, treatment, like, other medications or surgery, um, but it's not like Yeah. Yeah. Great point. So and and doctor Lynn and I were just talking about this because this is kind of that gray area. So if you're not in active full scale treatment, but you do have cancer or, like, you're you're in a monitoring phase or you're just taking oral medication, we do move you to the survivorship diet. So, again, that's the fruits, vegetables, whole grains, all that kind of stuff. So if you still always keep it in mind, we want to have the protein. We want you to be maintaining your weight. We want you to be hydrated. We want your symptoms to be under control. So we really just kind of move more towards that diet while still keeping that in the back of our mind is the most important.", "last_edit_date": "2024-11-06", "url": "https://mediasite.stanford.edu/Mediasite/Play/ca12283fe2ff4f90bccea88816ab19a91d", "block_metadata": {"block_type": "text", "language": "en", "time_range_minutes": "46-48", "speakers": ["Kate Donelan (MS, RD)", "Bryant Lin (MD)"], "lecture_title": "Nutrition During Cancer Treatment"}}
{"document_title": "Lectures", "section_title": "Lectures > Lecture 6", "content": "Just wanna do a brief time check. Yep. 3 minutes. Oh my gosh. Okay. Alright. So nausea interventions, since we've been talking about them so much, avoid hot fragrant foods, offer cold dry foods. If you're actively nauseous, go to a cold, dark room, lie down, have your eyes put in ice back to your forehead, roast your heart, take slowly breaths, peppermint, ginger, lemon pie. Those are the flavors that help with nausea in any way you wanna take them. Cdans, extremely effective. It costs about 10 bucks at CES. Avoiding $10 at CES. Avoiding metal near food. This is the taste stuff. So avoid metal near food. It can really make your taste buds go crazy. Mhmm. Uh, the baking soda salt brands, the FAST method stands for fast, acid, salts, and sweets. I send this to patients. There's a lot of stuff to read over about it. Different ways to add these things to your food to make them taste as good as possible. Okay. So, yeah, paraforducinealy, that was for the bowel movements. The Metamucil, again, for bowel movements. Okay. So, again, the significant concerns was that he had lost weight, and he was having the nausea with the vomiting. Okay? So this was the next appointment. The tasteability is the same. Heartburn is the same.", "last_edit_date": "2024-11-06", "url": "https://mediasite.stanford.edu/Mediasite/Play/ca12283fe2ff4f90bccea88816ab19a91d", "block_metadata": {"block_type": "text", "language": "en", "time_range_minutes": "47-49", "speakers": ["Kate Donelan (MS, RD)", "Bryant Lin (MD)"], "lecture_title": "Nutrition During Cancer Treatment"}}
{"document_title": "Lectures", "section_title": "Lectures > Lecture 6", "content": "Nausea is definitely improved. No episodes of vomiting. Um, mouth sores were continuing. Um, still, I feel like it could be taking more proteins if you see doctor Lin after we've done the protein. It's really hard to eat that much protein. It's like almost 6 chicken thighs a day. It's a lot of protein. It's a lot of protein. But his fluid I like meat too. His fluid had improved a lot. That was a a real one. So we can see improvements. You stop the weight loss. His weight stable, no vomiting, better nausea control, improved fluid intake. So lots of successes right off the bat. Alright. So this is the next one. So weight stable again. Okay? Improvement, 8 to 10. Heartburn was stable. Nausea, pretty much stable. Massage was continued. We're approved. Again, even better water intake this time. Still a little light on the protein. Improvement. Continuity. That's stable nausea control. Improve for more regular bowel movements. That's the other thing. The bowel moves had regulated probably from all the water. Okay.
