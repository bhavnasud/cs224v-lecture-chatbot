To run the MED-275 Chatbot:
1. Run web_app.py and download the relvant packages if required.
2. Go to the local host web adress that is printed out in the terminal. 
3. Type your question into the MED-275 question bar.
4. If you want to start a new conversation, such that the chatbot won't remember your previous queries, reload the webpage.
5. Enjoy!
