# cs224v-lecture-chatbot

To run the MED-275 Chatbot:
1. Run web_app.py and download the relvant packages if required.
2. Go to the local host web adress that is printed out in the terminal. 
3. Type your question into the MED-275 question bar.
4. If you want to start a new conversation, such that the chatbot won't remember your previous queries, reload the webpage.
5. Enjoy!

Limitations:
Lecture 2 was missing an audio recording, so the chatbot is unable to answer questions about lecture 2. Feel free to ask about it though to see how our chatbot responds when it does not have sufficient information. Lectures 1,3,4,5,6 are all fair game.
