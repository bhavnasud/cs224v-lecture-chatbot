# cs224v-lecture-chatbot

To run the MED-275 Chatbot:
1. Run web_app.py and download the relevant packages if required.
2. Go to the local host web address that is printed out in the terminal. 
3. Type your question into the MED-275 question bar.
4. If you want to start a new conversation, such that the chatbot won't remember your previous queries, reload the webpage.
5. Enjoy!

If you are unable to access the chatbot at port 5000 and you have a Mac, try going to System Settings > General > AirDrop & Handoff > AirPlay Receiver and turning it off.

Limitations:
Lecture 2 was missing an audio recording, so the chatbot is unable to answer questions about lecture 2. Feel free to ask about it though to see how our chatbot responds when it does not have sufficient information. Lectures 1,3,4,5, and 6 are all fair game.

If you're interested in looking at our implementation, we have many versions of the chatbot, but our final version is web_chatbot_v6.py.
