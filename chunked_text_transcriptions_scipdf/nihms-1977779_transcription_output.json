Smoking-related lung cancers account for the majority of lung cancer diagnoses and continue to claim ~100,000 lives in the USA each year 1 ; however, smoking rates have been decreasing for several decades. Although varying widely across the USA, cigarette smoking prevalence among adults reached an all-time low at 11.5% in 2021 (ref. 2), down by more than two-thirds (from ~42%) since the first Surgeon General's Report linking cigarette smoking to lung cancer and heart disease in 1964 (ref. 3) (Fig. 1a) and is projected to fall further to 7.5% overall by 2065 (ref. 4). As smoking prevalence has declined, some reports indicate that the proportion of lung cancers occurring in individuals who have never smoked (LCINS) has increased, particularly among women and in younger age groups 5 ."

LCINS have histological and epidemiological distinctions from smoking-related lung cancers given that they are almost exclusively adenocarcinomas and most commonly occur in women and individuals of Asian ancestry 7,8 . Moreover, several studies have revealed that LCINS are also genomically and molecularly distinct from smoking-related lung cancers, highly enriched for targetable oncogenic alterations (such as EGFR mutations or ALK rearrangements as well as less common alterations), and thus often require different diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. Over the past decade, new data have emerged regarding the genetic risk of LCINS, conferred by both common and rare germline variants, as well as environmental risk factors and potential interactions between the two. Conceivably, LCINS could eventually become the most common form of lung cancer, necessitating a thorough understanding of its pathogenesis and risk factors. Herein, we review the epidemiological, clinical and genomic features of LCINS, along with data from studies examining both genetic and environmental risk factors, as well as diagnostic and treatment strategies."

Definitions of smoking status have varied; however, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and others have previously used the term 'never-smoker' (or sometimes 'non-smoker') to refer to individuals who have smoked <100 cigarettes in their lifetime, and LCINS is defined as lung cancer arising in such individuals. The previously used terms 'former smoker' or 'ex-smoker' are defined as people who have smoked >100 cigarettes in their lifetime but quit smoking \u226512 months prior to a lung cancer diagnosis."

A current smoking status refers to individuals who have smoked >100 cigarettes in their lifetime and who still report smoking every day or some days. Nevertheless, data from several studies suggest that smoking history should be quantified as a continuous rather than discrete variable, supported by findings such as the likelihood of a lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) harbouring an EGFR mutation decreasing as number of pack-years increases 10 . As discussed below, the discovery of tumour mutational signatures corresponding to tobacco smoking might eventually help to delineate what constitutes a clinically significant level of exposure from a genomic perspective."

Trends in NSCLC histology also reflect the decreasing smoking prevalence, with a relative increase in LUAD and decrease in lung squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC) over time 36,37 . Precise national and global trends in LCINS epidemiology are unavailable owing to a lack of individual-level data on smoking status, which historically has not been collected in cancer registries or on death certificates.

Approximately 60% of samples had alterations in EGFR, KRAS, ALK, MET, HER2, RET or ROS1. As expected, median TMB was sevenfold less than that of smoking-related lung cancers at 1.1 mut/Mb, and no tobacco smoking signatures were observed, even in cases with reported passive smoking exposure 78 . The second study was the previously discussed WES and RNA-seq analysis of 160 tumour and matched non-malignant tissue samples from never-smoking patients with LUAD, with a substantially higher percentage of East Asian patients (62% European and 25% East Asian by inferred genetic ancestry), and including 40 and 36 samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Clinical Proteomic Tumour Analysis Consortium cohorts, respectively 7 .

The immune landscape of these LUADs was examined using RNA-seq and consensus clustering of immune and stromal cell type markers.

The WHO International Agency for Research in Cancer (IARC) 259 and US National Institutes of Health 260 have designated SHS as a human carcinogen, although SHS is generally accepted to confer only a modest risk of cancer and is not considered the sole causative factor for the majority of LCINS. Nonetheless, household exposure is probably more relevant than public exposure, and the continued declines in smoking rates as well as health regulations outlawing smoking in indoor public spaces will further mitigate the effects of SHS. Air pollution.-Air quality can be measured by quantifying the amounts of ozone, particulate matter and chemical pollutants in ambient air. Particle pollution is a combination of small liquid and solid particles that can comprise dust, metals, soil, acids and organic chemicals. These small, inhaled particles emitted from vehicle exhaust, forest fires, coalfired power plants and other industrial sources are thought to pass through the central airways and lodge in the more peripheral airways where LUADs typically form."

Established rare risk variants include loss-of-function mutations in tumour-suppressor genes as well as gain-of-function alterations in oncogenes, the latter of which underlie familial lung cancer syndromes associated with germline mutations in EGFR and HER2. Interactions between inherited genetic variants and the acquisition of somatic alterations as well as environmental exposures can affect the risk and management of LCINS (Fig. 4), underscoring the importance of studies evaluating matched tumour and non-malignant tissue samples. An example of such an interaction comes from the previously discussed study in which germline ATM L2307F mutations were found to be associated with LUAD arising in individuals with a history of light versus heavy smoking, later age of onset, and broad and local somatic features (that is, EGFR mutation and biallelic ATM inactivation, respectively) 177 ."

Treatments for lung cancer typically target somatic alterations irrespective of germline genetic background, although a study in patients with SCLC demonstrated that PGVs in DNA repair genes can influence recurrence-free survival and response to agents targeting defective DNA repair 190 . Considering ICI treatment and toxicity, a germline PRS enriched for variants regulating gene expression in macrophages and dendritic cells has been shown to predict the nature of the tumour immune microenvironment and ICI response 318 . Additionally, a germline PRS for hypothyroidism is predictive of thyroid-specific immunerelated adverse events in patients with NSCLC 319 .

Testing methods vary, although panel-based NGS is preferable to maximize target coverage. Blood-based NGS might not detect driver alterations owing to insufficient shedding of tumour DNA; therefore, samples cannot be deemed oncogene negative based on liquid biopsy results alone. Most fusions (for example, those involving ALK, ROS1 or RET) are detectable with break-apart FISH assays or hybrid capture-based NGS, and DNA-based NGS has been used to identify novel fusion partners not detectable with FISH and reverse transcription PCR 80 .

Advances have been made in understanding LCINS biology at the somatic exome and genome levels, yet the germline contribution remains largely unexplored and large-scale sequencing studies in diverse populations are needed to define germline genetic risk. Furthermore, our understanding of environmental carcinogens continues to evolve, and future directions for research should include the mechanisms driving carcinogenesis mediated by non-tobacco-related exposures, such as environmental pollution, and their interaction with underlying germline variation. The biological distinctions between LCINS and smoking-related lung cancers necessitate a unique approach to diagnosis and treatment, with integration of environmental exposures and both germline and somatic genetics to deliver precision oncology strategies for the treatment and prevention of this increasingly important disease."
