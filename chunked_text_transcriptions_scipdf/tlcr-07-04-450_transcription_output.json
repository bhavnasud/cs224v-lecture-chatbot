The majority of lung cancers are thought to be attributed to direct tobacco exposure. However, approximately 10% to 25% of all lung cancers occur in never smokers (2,3), defined as those who smoked fewer than 100 cigarettes during their lifetime. Notably, epidemiologic studies reveal that the proportion of lung cancer in never smokers (LCINS) is higher in East Asia, including China, Japan, Mongolia, North Korea, and South Korea, and approximately one third of all lung cancer patients are LCINS [39.7% in China (our unpublished data), 38% in South Korea (4) and 32.8% in Japan (5)]. The high proportion of LCINS is mainly due to low smoking prevalence of East Asian females with lung cancer [9.9% in South Korea, 17-25.6% in Japan, 28.3% in Hong Kong, 6.4% in Taiwan, and 5.2% in China (our unpublished data)], which was significantly lower than that in Caucasian female patients (ranging from 53% to 91%) (4)(5)(6)(7)(8)(9)(10)."

Although the reason remains unknown, a better understanding of the epidemiologic and biologic characteristics of never-smokers has become increasingly important. Never-smokers in East Asians are more often diagnosed with adenocarcinoma, a subtype largely defined by oncogenic drivers (11). The proportion of never-smokers in lung squamous cell carcinoma (SQCC) and small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is also higher among East Asian patients than in non-Asian patients (12,13). Therefore, oncologists in East Asia have more opportunities to treat never-smoking patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in clinical practice. In this review, we will provide an overview of the East Asian experience in the treatment of advanced, never-smoking lung cancer."

The role of environmental tobacco exposure in the development of LCINS has been widely studied. A recent pooled study from 18 case-control studies in the International Lung Cancer Consortium, including 766 cases and 1,954 control who were never-smokers from Asian, has demonstrated that exposure to second-hand smoke is associated with an increased risk of lung cancer in neversmokers [odds ratio (OR) =1.31, 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.17-1.47) (14). Moreover, the strongest association was observed in SCLC (OR =1.26, 95% CI: 1.10-1.44 for adenocarcinoma; OR =1.41, 95% CI: 0.99-1.99 for SQCC; OR =1.48, 95% CI: 0.89-2.45 for large cell lung cancer; OR =3.09, 95% CI: 1.62-5.89 for SCLC) (14). Based on data from the Global Adult Tobacco Survey (GATS) conducted from December 2009 to March 2010 (15,16), the prevalence of current smokers in adult age more than 15 years old was 28.1% in China, with an estimated more than 300 million current smokers."

Another important factor associated with an increased risk of LCINS is exposure to cooking fumes, as several case-control studies have identified cooking oil fumes as a risk factor for lung cancer among Chinese never-smoking women (17)(18)(19)(20). A recent meta-analysis including 13 studies, with a total of 3,596 lung cancer women and 6,082 healthy controls also validated the positive relationship between cooking oil fume exposure and lung cancer among Chinese never-smoking women, with a risk ratio (RR) of 1.74 (95% CI: 1.57-1.94) (21). Other factors that play a role in the etiology of LCINS in non-smokers from East Asia also include inherited genetic susceptibility (22)(23)(24), occupational and environmental exposure (25), hormonal factors (26), pre-existing lung diseases (27)(28)(29)(30), suggesting that the etiopathogenesis of LCINS is a complex process with multiple risk factors involved."

Robust evidence has identified EGFR sensitizing mutation as the most relevant predictor of response to the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) (42)(43)(44). Several randomized phase III trials have consistently demonstrated that gefitinib, erlotinib and afatinib are more effective in terms of objective response rate (ORR) and progression-free survival (PFS), and better tolerated than standard platinumbased doublet chemotherapy in advanced NSCLC patients harboring EGFR activating mutation. Among these trials, IPASS, LUX-LUNG 6 trial was conducted in Asian (45,46), First-SIGNAL trial was conducted in South Korea (47), OPTIMAL, ENSURE, and CONVINCE trial were conducted in China (48)(49)(50), WJTOG3405 and NEJ002 trial were conducted in Japan (51,52). To date, EGFR-TKI treatment has been the most important targeted therapy in lung adenocarcinoma from East Asia never-smokers as approximately 70% of these patients have the opportunity to receive EGFR-TKI treatment.

Furthermore, pembrolizumab has been approved as first-line therapy for advanced NSCLC patients with PD-L1 positive tumors (\u226550%) based on the results of KEYNOTE-024 trial (133). Of note, the current obstacle to the wide use of anti-PD-1/ PD-L1 antibodies is lack of biomarker to identify beneficial patient population because only about 20% of patients with NSCLC respond to anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies. Tumor mutation burden (TMB) has recently been identified as a promising biomarker for response to immune checkpoint inhibitors (134). Patients with high nonsynonymous burden had higher ORR (63% vs. 0%, P=0.03) and better PFS (14.5 vs. 3.7 months, HR =0.19, 95% CI: 0.05-0.70, P=0.01) than those with low nonsynonymous burden. High TMB can increase the number of neoantigens, which are recognized by T cells, therefore enhancing tumor immunogenicity and leading to an antitumor immune response (134). These preliminary findings have been confirmed in an exploratory analysis of CheckMate-026 trial (135). In CheckMate-026 trial, although nivolumab did not prolong the PFS as compared with chemotherapy in patients with previously untreated advanced NSCLC with PD-L1-positive tumors (\u22655%), the ORR (47% vs."

Genomic analysis has demonstrated that smokers had a significantly higher number of mutations \nPFS, progression-free survival; SQCC, squamous cell carcinoma. per Mb (median 10.5, range 4.9-17.6) than neversmokers with NSCLC (median 0.6, range 0.6-0.9) (134). Therefore, smokers are more likely to induce greater TMB and derive clinical benefit from checkpoint inhibitors than never-smokers. Interestingly, Kinoshita et al. found that non-smokers with adenocarcinoma can generate an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and inhibit CD8 + T-cell activation, suggesting checkpoint inhibitors may not be effective in this subtype of patients (136). However, in a recent meta-analysis, the treatment benefit for checkpoint inhibitors was independent of smoking history (current and former smokers vs. never smokers: HR for death, 0.69 vs. 0.79; interaction, P=0.40) (137). Actually, it is the molecular smoking signature rather than selfreported smoking history that is significantly related to the clinical benefit from checkpoint inhibitors (134). Therefore, there is currently lack of robust evidence to select the beneficial population by smoking history for checkpoint inhibitor therapy."

        "text": "As mentioned above, the vast majority of neversmoking East Asians with NSCLC have adenocarcinoma, a subtype largely defined by oncogenic drivers. Although tremendous efficacy has been achieved in these patients with the administration of targeted therapy, the survival outcomes are not satisfactory. Whether checkpoint inhibitors can generate a durable response of these patients, therefore, becomes of great importance. However, recent randomized trials and meta-analysis revealed that patients with EGFR mutations did not derive survival benefit from checkpoint inhibitors (128)(129)(130)(131)(132)138). A recent retrospective study also demonstrated that EGFR mutations or ALK rearrangement was associated with low response to checkpoint inhibitors (3.6%, 1/28) (139). The poor response to checkpoint inhibitors in patients with EGFR mutations or ALK rearrangement may result from a potentially immunosuppressive microenvironment in these patients (139). EGFR mutation was also correlated with uninflamed phenotype and weak immunogenicity, with decreased PD-L1 expression, lack of T-cell infiltration, and lower TMB (140). A recent report showed that High CD73 expression in EGFR-mutant NSCLC may be another cause that contribute to the reduced benefit from checkpoint inhibitors, which can alter immune cell function and is correlated with low PD-L1 expression (141)."

        "text": "Sabari et al recently reported preliminary results of immunotherapy in NSCLC with METex14 skipping (142). However, only 1 patient (6.7%, 1/15) responded to checkpoint inhibitors and median PFS was only 2.3 months. TMB was lower in patients with METex14 skipping and no partial response was observed even in patients with high TMB (142). Current evidence suggests that never-smoking adenocarcinoma from East Asia, the potentially beneficial population of targeted therapy, do not seem to be the same beneficial population of immunotherapy. Notably, although this review focuses on East Asia, most of the data comes from China, Japan, and South Korea and we have little information about Mongolia and North Korea. Furthermore, China is a huge country with a diverse ethnic population. Almost all the reported data in Chinese targets Han population. As the ethnic minorities have distinct life-styles, growing backgrounds, diets and living conditions compared with Han population, the genetic profiles may also differ. For example, Uyghur population, mainly living in North-west of China, had significantly lower EGFR mutation rate than Han population (12% vs. 55.1%) (143). Therefore, these experiences and treatment strategies cannot be directly generalized to other East Asians, namely Mongolians and North Koreans, and Chinese ethnic minorities, and further studies are still needed in these populations."

        "text": "Conclusions: In summary, approximately one third of all lung cancer patients in East Asia are LCINS. Never-smokers are more often diagnosed with adenocarcinoma in East Asian, a subtype largely defined by oncogenic drivers. In this subgroup of patients, as high as 90% of patients have been found to harbor well-known oncogenic mutations and can be successfully managed with targeted therapy inhibiting specific oncogenic mutant kinases. Lung SQCC and SCLC are two common histologic type of smokingrelated NSCLC. The incidence of LCINS also increases over time in East Asian patients. Recent studies suggest that lung SQCC and SCLC in never-smokers may be distinct subtypes, and better understanding of the biologic characteristics of these subtypes of patients may provide new insights for the treatment of these patients. Although Immunotherapy with immune checkpoint blockade generates durable response in some patients with advanced NSCLC, lung adenocarcinoma from East Asian neversmokers do not seem to be the beneficial population. These findings may reflect the considerably lower total mutation burden (and thus fewer neoantigens) in never smokers. However, there is currently lack of robust evidence to guide checkpoint inhibitor treatment by smoking history. "
