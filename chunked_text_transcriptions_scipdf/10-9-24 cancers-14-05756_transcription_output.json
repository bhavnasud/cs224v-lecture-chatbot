        "text": "Introduction: Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer-related death in the United States (US) with 5-year survival rates for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and small cell lung cancer (SCLC) of 25% and 7%, respectively [1]. While early stage lung cancer can often be treated surgically, ninety percent of those diagnosed with lung cancer will die of the disease in part due to late-stage (Stages III or IV) presentation and lethality of this disease [2]. Prognosis largely reflects stage at diagnosis, with 5-year survival rates for early stage localized lung cancer of 63% and 27% for late-stage lung cancer [1]. While screening asymptomatic individuals for lung cancer using low dose computed tomography (LDCT) in high-risk patients has been recommended in the US since 2012 [3], uptake has been limited and most individuals with lung cancer are diagnosed following symptomatic presentation [4,5]. Detection of potential lung cancer among symptomatic individuals is challenging as their symptoms are difficult to distinguish from more common conditions [6][7][8]."

        "text": "Moreover, the time interval from symptom onset to diagnosis of lung cancer can be considerable; a study of over 48,000 patients using Medicare claims identified a median interval from symptom onset to diagnosis of 187 days (25-75% IQR 36-308 days) [9]. The long pre-diagnosis time interval for symptomatic lung cancer may be a target for quality improvement interventions with the aim of earlier detection. Notably, diagnostic errors related to lung cancer are among the most common causes of major malpractice claims in outpatient settings [10,11]. Clinical quality measures (CQM) are used to evaluate or set benchmarks of processes, outcomes, patient perceptions, or organizational structures in healthcare that equate to higher quality care and drive institutional improvements. The World Health Organization, for example, has set a goal of 90 days from symptom onset to treatment of lung cancer [12], while guidelines in Canada recommend time from presentation to diagnosis should be a maximum of four weeks [13,14]. In Denmark, clinical quality indicators have been used for more than 20 years to improve a range of outcome indicators for lung cancer [15]."

        "text": "However, despite the significant potential opportunities to improve care in the US [16], there are no CQMs focused on the timeliness of diagnosis of lung cancer currently used in the US. Developing a CQM for diagnosis of lung cancer is complex; this condition includes multiple parts of the health care system (e.g., primary care, specialists, inpatient care, radiology) which would be reflected in the multiple types and sources of data needed to populate a CQM. Current gaps in defining a CQM include how to define and operationalize key timepoints in the pre-diagnosis period using electronic health record (EHR) data, as well as defining expected ranges for time intervals. The overall aim of this study was therefore to define key time points and describe intervals in the diagnostic pathway of patients with lung cancer based on a single site in the US, from initial symptomatic presentation in ambulatory care to diagnosis, using routine EHR data. We believe our findings provide valuable new information that not only describe the timeliness of the diagnostic process for lung cancer, but could also potentially be used to inform efforts to develop CQM for lung cancer in a range of health care settings Cancers 2022, 14, 5756 3 of 18"

We chose the pre-diagnosis time interval to provide data to fulfill the ambulatory care relationship (as noted above), and post-diagnosis to ensure there was complete data to verify or cross-check date of diagnosis. Extracted data included demographics (smoking status, age, sex, race, ethnicity), all ICD 9 or 10 diagnostic and Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes linked to encounters, as well as unstructured clinical notes for any of the above encounters. Study records from the EDW were then linked to the Seattle/Puget Sound Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program cancer registry which provided history of previous cancers, histology, date and stage of diagnosis, and date of initial treatment."

Interviews with patients who have recalled their early clinical presentations of lung cancer have highlighted a period of months or years prior to diagnosis, where individuals describe bodily changes, which may initially be dismissed or not attributed to cancer by patients or health care providers due to lack of awareness or fear of illness [35][36][37][38][39]. This important finding suggests unrealized value in considering CQMs here. The time intervals we identified from initial chest imaging and/or consultation with specialists to diagnosis (43 and 71 days, respectively) are longer than those noted in some previous studies from the US. A recent study that used SEER-Medicare data for patients with NSCLC identified a median of 20 days between radiographic suspicion and diagnosis [34]. Another study described median intervals from abnormal chest imaging to treatment of 36.5 days, and specialist consultation to treatment of 27 days [40]. However, a small study of 129 Veterans noted a far longer median time from first chest imaging suspicious of cancer to treatment of approximately 3 months [41]. The short time interval we identified from diagnosis to treatment initiation (median of 7 days) is at the lower end of a range of previous reports of this time interval including a range of 6-45 days [42] and 22 days [43], and from specialist appointment to surgical intervention of 59 days [44].

While the demographics of our cohort is reflective of the population in Washington state, our cohort has fewer patients who identify as African American or those from rural areas than other regions in the US, therefore our findings may not be representative nationally or among patients not attending academic health science centers. This is important as there is evidence of disparities in cancer diagnosis among rural and other underserved communities in the US [49].

Missing data due to care received at non-UWM sites could have altered the time intervals. However, we took special care to exclude patients as non-informative who may not have received their pre-diagnosis care at UWM. Furthermore, NLP extraction is limited by performance of the annotation tool used and what the provider documents, which could vary widely from provider to provider. Third, our definition of onset of clinical presentation based on the documentation of a certain number of symptoms/signs associated with lung cancer may be too non-specific and merely reflect other concomitant illness, however these clinical features are consistent with multiple other studies that have examined clinical presentation of lung cancer in ambulatory care [6,17,51]."

Our study demonstrates that key clinical features are recorded by clinicians in the EHR for a considerable period prior to diagnosis among patients who are later diagnosed with lung cancer. Tools could be implemented in EHR data to flag clinical signs that raise the probability of lung cancer, potentially using sophisticated models, although this would need to be balanced with the risks of unnecessary investigations and referrals. The time intervals we describe, if validated by other research, could inform upper limits of intervals for several steps in the pre-diagnosis period as part of a CQM. Interventional studies will be needed to determine the impacts of such measures on time to diagnosis, stage, overall survival as well as unintended negative impacts on healthcare utilization. However, we found few differences in symptoms/signs with stage at diagnosis; other studies suggest the symptom burden is indeed higher in patients with more advanced stage but that there may not be an association between longer diagnostic interval and later stage disease [52,53]."
