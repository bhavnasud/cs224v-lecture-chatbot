[3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11][12] However, although the field of cancer disparities has grown, granular data on cancer care delivery continue to be derived from studies with predominantly English-speaking patients. Patients with limited English proficiency (LEP) remain underrepresented in the literature addressing cancer disparities, even though there are .25 million LEP individuals in the United States, an increase of 80% since 1990. 13,14 Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 provides legal protection against discrimination on the basis of race, color, and national origin. 15,16 Unfortunately, LEP patients continue to encounter language barriers that significantly impact their ability to fully participate in their medical care as a result of multifaceted challenges in the implementation of national medical interpreting guidelines."

Multidisciplinary cancer disparities research offers promise for increasing equitable access to high-quality cancer care. However, without an understanding of the systems-level barriers to access for LEP patients with cancer-a vulnerable and highly relevant populationour ability to design interventions to promote cancer health equity will be limited. To examine the impact of patients' spoken language on access to cancer care, we conducted an audit study in which trained investigators called the hospital general information telephone line as a patient seeking to access cancer care and spoke in 1 of the 3 most common spoken languages in the United States: English, Spanish, and Mandarin. 31 We hypothesized that linguistic variation exists in patients' access to cancer care, with non-English-speaking patients at greater risk for worse access."

We selected 4 states within each region type (high LEP region: California, Florida, New York, Texas; intermediate LEP region: Arizona, Illinois, Massachusetts, New Jersey; low LEP region: Michigan, Missouri, Oregon, Pennsylvania). 13 We subsequently identified the 3 most diverse counties within each state based on the size of the county's LEP population. 13 We obtained a comprehensive list of all hospitals located within the 36 counties of interest from the American Hospital Association Annual Survey Database."

The rationale for contacting the hospital general information line is that it serves as the initial entry point for many individuals seeking to obtain information about hospital clinics and services and is thus a highly relevant site to evaluate cancer care access for patients. Furthermore, we examined access to care for colon and lung cancer, 2 of the 3 most common causes of cancer death for Hispanic and Asian patients, and thyroid cancer, the second most common cancer among Hispanic and Asian women in the United States. 34,35 A total of 6 trained investigators (ie, 2 per language type) were assigned to the roles of English-speaking, Spanish-speaking, and Mandarin-speaking patients seeking to access cancer care."

The lower likelihood of simulated patient callers being provided with the next steps to access cancer care when calling nonteaching hospitals likely reflects differential access to language-based resources. In a national survey of 861 hospitals in the United States, the Health Research and Educational Trust and the National Health Law Program reported that nonteaching hospitals had fewer resources available for providing patients with language services. Specifically, nonteaching hospitals were  less likely than teaching hospitals to report the availability of staff interpreters (66% vs 76%), external interpretation agencies (61% vs 87%), language-based telephonic services (89% vs 99%), and bilingual nonclinical staff (70% vs 90%) (all P,.05). 33 This discrepancy in the availability of resources may in part be due to nonteaching hospitals being less likely to receive reimbursement for language services than teaching hospitals (2% vs 10%; P,.05)."

Second, our study findings may not be generalizable to all non-English-speaking patients with cancer. It is likely that patients who speak other less commonly spoken non-English languages or who reside in regions with a very small LEP population (ie, LEP population of ,120,000 in the state) face even greater barriers to accessing cancer care than those identified in our study. Third, our study does not capture the complexities of hospital call center workflows, and thus, we are limited in our ability to ascertain the reasons behind the observed outcomes of the telephone calls.
